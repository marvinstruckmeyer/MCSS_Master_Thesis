WtBAVQvLjFo,Trump Tariffs: China Says It's Considering US Trade Talks | The Opening Trade 05/02,"China said it is assessing the possibility of trade talks with the US, the first sign since Donald Trump hiked tariffs last month that negotiations could begin between the two sides. China’s Commerce Ministry said in a Friday statement that it had noted senior US officials repeatedly expressing their willingness to talk to Beijing about tariffs, and urged officials in Washington to show “sincerity” toward China. 

Europe’s Stoxx 600 rose, advancing for a ninth day in the longest winning streak in almost a year. S&P 500 futures climbed before key US payrolls data on hopes for a detente in the trade war.

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Kriti Gupta, Tom Mackenzie and Lizzy Burden.

C-ChODohZTw,"Canada Election: Carney's Narrow Win, Spain Power Outage Aftermath | The Opening Trade 04/29","Spain and Portugal were returning to some semblance of normality early Tuesday,  with many questions remaining about what caused one of Europe’s worst blackouts in years across the Iberian peninsula the previous day.Canada’s Liberal Party is projected to win a fourth consecutive election, giving a mandate to former central banker Mark Carney after a campaign in which he pledged to stand up to US President Donald Trump. 

Carney’s party had about 43% of the national vote, but may fall short of the 172 seats needed for a majority in the House of Commons, meaning the government would be forced to work with other parties to pass budgets and other legislation.

ClQL_vaZMIc,"Trump Tariffs: Shein Price Hike as Much as 377%, Temu Doubles Some Prices | The Opening Trade 04/28","US Supply chains start to feel the force of President Donald Trump's tariffs. Since the US raised levies on China to 145% in early April, cargo shipments have plummeted, perhaps by as much as 60%, according to one estimate.

Fast-fashion giant Shein raised US prices of its products from dresses to kitchenware ahead of imminent tariffs on small parcels, in an early sign of the potential effect of the trade war on American consumers. While discount Chinese retail app Temu, appears to be passing on nearly all of Donald Trump’s new import taxes to US consumers, more than doubling the cost of some products.

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Guy Johnson and Lizzy Burden.

hxcICLvipOo,"Trump Eyes Cutting China Tariffs ‘Substantially’, Dials Back Fed Threats | The Opening Trade 04/23","“It will come down substantially but it won’t be zero,” President Donald Trump said Tuesday in Washington, following earlier comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the standoff was unsustainable. Trump said he plans to be “very nice” to China in any trade talks and that tariffs will drop if the two countries can reach a deal, adding that he didn’t see the need to say he’d “play hardball” with Chinese leader Xi Jinping -- a sign he may be backing down from his tough stance on Beijing amid market volatility. After complaining that the Fed was not cutting interest rates quickly enough, Trump said he had no intention of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell despite his frustration with the central bank.

7nUfBfKGGjc,Trump Tariffs: 'Sell America' Becomes Real Trump Trade | The Opening Trade 04/22,"Trump’s renewed tirades against the Federal Reserve, including the most explicit threats yet to fire Chair Jerome Powell, only amplified the shockwaves from his declaration of trade war on pretty much everyone. Trump has rattled Wall Street by repeatedly criticizing Powell and suggesting he had the ability to remove the Fed Chair before the end of his term. Gold extended a blistering rally to rise above $3,500 an ounce for the first time, as concern on Powell triggered a flight from US stocks, bonds and the dollar. Novo Nordisk shares fall as much as 9.8% in their first day of trading since Wednesday after the release of strong data from a rival obesity pill developed by US peer Eli Lilly. The triumph of Ozempic, Wegovy and related drugs including Lilly’s Zepbound has set off a push toward the new: a pill that’s easier to take and less expensive to make.

COqS6X3_fdg,Gold Prices Surge Again as Expanding Trade War Bolsters Haven Demand,"Gold’s steady rise suggests it’s becoming the fallback asset of choice, with other havens failing to deliver as they once would. After breaking through the psychological barrier of $3,000, momentum has only increased. BlackRock's Evy Hambro says the precious metal is a wise choice for a store of wealth, arguing that if you could buy an Apple iPhone with gold, it would cost you 30% less today than it did when the first iPhone was first released, despite a retail price which has tripled.

SuVJq-VGvvI,"Roubini on Trade War, Trump Tariffs, Goldman Sees Gold at $4K | The Opening Trade 04/14","President Donald Trump pledged he will still apply tariffs to phones, computers and popular consumer electronics, downplaying a weekend exemption from 125% tariffs on China as a procedural step in his overall push to remake US trade. The dollar weakened to a six-month low on concern that the confusion around the Trump administration’s tariff policy will drive traders away from US assets. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index rallied, while futures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 advanced at least 1.5%. Apple shares jumped in premarket trading. The late Friday tech tariff exemption is temporary and a part of the longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the sector. Trump doubled down on the plan Sunday. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” Trump said in a social media post Sunday. Our big guest of the morning - famed economist Nouriel Roubini on everything trade, tariffs and markets. 

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

tAT1fjIsR_M,"China Raises US Tariffs, UK Economy Growth Surges | The Opening Trade 04/11","China retaliated against President Donald Trump’s latest tariffs by hiking duties on all US goods, while calling the administration’s actions a “joke” and saying it no longer considers them worth matching. Beijing will raise tariffs on all US goods from 84% to 125% starting April 12, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday, after the White House clarified that levies on Chinese goods rose to 145% this year. Britain’s economy posted the strongest growth in almost a year in February as factories ramped up production ahead of Trump’s wave of tariffs. While the figures are a major boost for the Labour government and puts the economy on course for a positive first quarter, the respite could be fleeting as the White House started to upend the global economic order with a slew of tariff announcements in March and April.

gY6uBFSNDVc,European Stocks Jump Most in Five Years on Trump Tariff Pause | The Opening Trade 04/10,"European stocks rallied after US President Donald Trump paused plans to implement higher reciprocal tariffs on dozens of trade partners, easing concerns about a global trade war -- though he still plans to move forward with 125% tariffs on China. Trump’s announcement sent US stocks up by the most since 2008 on Wednesday, though the S&P 500 remains down more than 7% so far this year. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was higher with all sectors in the green and banks and miners leading gains. France’s CAC 40 jumped and Germany’s DAX soared.  While the Trump's automotive tariffs didn’t begin until after the first quarter ended, Volkswagen’s results offer an early look at the wide-ranging impacts of US President Donald Trump’s levies on the car industry. The carmaker's profit tumbled almost 40% in the first quarter.

90spN7mNKb8,"Trump 104% China Tariffs Kick In, 'Fire Sale' on US Treasuries | The Opening Trade 04/09","President Donald Trump is pushing ahead with tariffs on roughly 60 trading partners that he dubbed the “worst offenders” that took effect after midnight New York time. Most critically, the president plans to forge ahead with what would amount to a 104% levy on many Chinese goods. A selloff in longer-dated US Treasuries accelerated, worsening the slump in bond equivalents across the globe, as an escalation in the trade war sowed doubts over the haven status of US government debt. Every sector in Europe was down at the market open, but drugmakers are the biggest decliners so far after Trump’s comments that the US would be “announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals”.  The Stoxx 600 Health Care Index has dropped to the lowest since October 2022. Weight-loss and diabetes drugmaker Novo Nordisk slumped along with AstraZeneca, GSK stocks also falling.

l-jppS0a7ko,Trump Tariffs Spark European Stock Market Meltdown | The Opening Trade 04/07,"The carnage in financial markets unleashed by President Donald Trump’s tariffs is continuing unabated as equities get pummeled and US stock futures show that last week’s $5 trillion wipeout isn’t over. It’s a sea of red in Europe, with major benchmarks falling sharply. The Euro Stoxx 600 fell more than 5%. Germany’s DAX plunged more than 10% at the open, before trimming losses.  Concerns about the economic impact of the tariffs are pushing investors to ramp up central bank rate-cut bets. Trump struck a defiant tone on his tariff policy and dashed any hopes of a quick U-turn, telling reporters on Sunday evening to “forget markets for a second.”
The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. Traders now expect the Fed to cut another five times this year. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

onxH8OECot0,Trump Tariffs: US Stock Futures Sink as China Retaliates | Opening Trade 04/04,"President Trump defends his tariffs and dismisses the market meltdown. Rattled investors now await US Payrolls data with the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell due to speak today. US stock futures tumbled as much as 4.1% early Friday after China retaliated against new US tariffs with levies on all American imports, exacerbating a rout that sent American equities to the worst day since 2020 on Thursday. Contracts on the S&P 500 Index plunged as China imposed a 34% tariff on all American imports starting April 10. All of the Magnificent Seven stocks including Nvidia, Tesla, and Apple fell premarket.

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Guy Johnson and Lizzy Burden.

5B7IvIRAAHI,Trump Tariffs: US Emerges as Biggest Loser in Markets | The Opening Trade 04/03,"President Donald Trump’s shake-up of the global trading system is hurting US assets more than those in many of the big economies he has just slapped with additional tariffs. US equity index futures tumbled after Trump announced a sweeping series of tariffs following the market close on Wednesday, and a gauge of the dollar slumped. But the impact elsewhere was less extreme. The Stoxx Europe 600 was down trading while the Euro was up against the dollar, hitting its highest level since October. 
The widespread selloff in global markets makes clear that investors don’t expect any winners from the latest — and by the far the largest — salvo in a growing trade war. 

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

omsNL9L7ZXY,European Stocks Fall as Trump Tariff Announcement Looms Over Markets | The Opening Trade 04/02,"Europe’s Stoxx 600 Index fell hours before President Donald Trump’s tariffs announcement in the White House Rose Garden, with speculation swirling over the details of the proposed trade action. Healthcare stocks were among the biggest losers as mass layoffs at the US Department of Health sowed uncertainty over the outlook for vaccines and gene therapies. Among single stocks, Mercedes fell after Bloomberg reported the automaker could withdraw its least expensive cars from the US if tariffs make their sales unfeasible. Several proposals are said to be under consideration, including a tiered tariff system with a set of flat rates for countries, as well as a more customized reciprocal plan. The White House has said the tariffs would take immediate effect, but that Trump was open to subsequent negotiation.
The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

SoftBank is seeking a loan of as much as $16.5 billion to help fund artificial intelligence investments in the US, people familiar with the matter said, in what would be its largest-ever borrowing denominated solely in dollars.

President Donald Trump said he was ""very angry"" at Vladimir Putin and threatened ""secondary tariffs"" on buyers of Russian oil if Putin refuses a ceasefire with Ukraine. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen was convicted of embezzlement by a Paris court — but judges haven’t yet said if she will pick up a ban that stops her from running to be France’s next president.

m-Kqg19XwX0,"Fed's Powell Downplays Growing Risks, Trump Says Fed Should Cut Rates | The Opening Trade 03/20","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell downplayed growth concerns and the impact of President Donald Trump's trade war on inflation, Speaking to reporters following a two-day meeting of policymakers, Powell downplayed mounting growth concerns and the price hits that could be on the way from President Donald Trump’s aggressive trade war. He even revived a once-abandoned term to say the inflationary impact of tariffs is likely to be transitory. Fed officials held their benchmark interest rate steady on Wednesday for a second straight meeting, as expected by economists. President Donald Trump said the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates, splitting with the US central bank as officials weigh the economic cost of his tariff push.

Rqw8uszbt_w,"Erdogan’s Main Rival Detained, German Bundestag Backs Landmark Spending Bill | Opening Trade 03/19","Turkey’s lira sank, an equity selloff triggered a trading halt, and government bond yields surged to the highest levels this year as investors dumped the nation’s assets after the arrest of a Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The lira plunged more than 10% to new record lows on news of the arrest early on Wednesday. The benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 Index was also down, with the banking sub-index dropping. The declines were the worst in the world among respective asset classes. German lawmakers passed a landmark spending package that could unlock hundreds of billions of euros in debt financing for defense and infrastructure and heralding the end of decades of budget austerity. The legislation will head to a vote on Friday at the Bundesrat, where Germany’s 16 federal states are represented.

WRUAsqqFeJE,"Germany's €500B Spending Bill Vote, Trump & Putin to Talk Ukraine Truce | Opening Trade 03/18","German lawmakers will vote on a bill Tuesday that would unlock hundreds of billions of euros in debt-financed defense and infrastructure spending in Europe’s biggest economy. Conservative Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz and the Social Democrats last week sealed an agreement with the Greens that should secure the two-thirds majority needed for the law to pass the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, barring any last-minute surprises. President Donald Trump said the US and Russia are already talking about dividing “assets” as part of a push to end the fighting in Ukraine, the latest sign that he may be preparing to sacrifice Kyiv’s interests when he speaks with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. One objective of the call is expected to be getting the Russian president to agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Trump proposed this month and Ukraine has agreed to. Putin has been noncommittal so far.

wrwAONGsKQM,Russia-Ukraine Latest: Trump to Speak with Putin Tuesday in Ceasefire Push | Opening Trade 03/17,"President Donald Trump said he’ll speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday as the US presses for an end to fighting in Ukraine and European nations rush to bolster their support for Kyiv. Yet that effort has sparked angst among European leaders who worry President Donald Trump may concede too much on Ukraine’s behalf in a direct exchange with Putin and leave Kyiv without any longer-term security guarantees. Trump believes there is a ""very good chance"" for a deal, and the discussion will focus on territory, power plants, and dividing up certain assets.

SaT8jcJaV1k,"Mark Carney Wins Canada PM Race, US Recession Risk Grows | Opening Trade 03/10","Mark Carney won the race to become Canada’s next prime minister, putting the former central banker in charge of the country just as US President Donald Trump’s administration threatens its economic future. Thex-Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor won the contest to lead the Liberal Party of Canada with nearly 86% of the vote. “America is not Canada. And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form,” Carney said in his victory speech on Sunday. Wall Street stock futures dropped and Treasuries ticked higher as Trump’s protectionist policies and cuts to the federal workforce dented confidence in US economic outperformance. Contracts for the S&P 500 declined 1%, following the worst week for the benchmark index since September. European stocks slipped 0.4%.

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Guy Johnson, Kriti Gupta and Lizzy Burden.

FXi-d9o-Amg,"Bitcoin Plunges, China Blasts Trump’s ‘Two-Faced Acts’ | Opening Trade 03/07","China’s top diplomat accused Donald Trump of taking a hypocritical approach to bilateral ties and denounced tariffs, as tensions rise between the world’s largest economies. Foreign Minister Wang Yi defended his nation’s actions on stemming the flow of fentanyl to the US on Friday at a high-profile briefing, and accused the Republican leader of using the issue as a pretext to pressure his government. A simmering tension in the crypto industry resurfaced after Trump signed a long-awaited order creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Even as crypto executives issued effusive social media posts praising the move, Bitcoin fell as much as 5.7%.

ZdFGTS9Y7EE,"French Nuclear Shield Talks, Global Bonds Sell-off, Trump's Tariff Delays | The Opening Trade 03/06","Europe enters a new era of defence. President Emmanuel Macron said he’ll commence talks to use France’s nuclear capabilities to defend allies on the continent. It's the latest push by a European country to establish strategic security as the US reduces its footprint on the continent. Germany’s spending plan drove Bunds on Wednesday to their worst session since 1990. The selloff extended Thursday to lift yields by another 10 basis points and spread to other . Bond investors are now waiting for the European Central Bank’s meeting, which is expected to deliver a 25 basis-point interest rate cut. President Donald Trump is exempting automakers from newly imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada for one month, the White House said Wednesday, as a temporary reprieve following pleas from leaders at Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis on the matter on Tuesday, according to some of the people, who weren’t authorized to discuss details publicly.

gbcQn9QBoms,"German Bonds Yields Soar on Investment Plans, Tariff Relief Hint Optimism | The Opening Trade 03/05","US futures are in the green after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted at tariffs relief. This after a wild day of trading following Donald Trump’s most recent tariff actions against Canada, Mexico, and China, with the S&P 500 Index closing at its lowest level since before last year’s election. Trump signalled  there could be more discomfort ahead. Germany’s decision to exempt defense from limits on fiscal spending in response to dwindling US support is cascading through markets. It signals a turnaround in the nation’s ironclad borrowing rules, spurring optimism for an economic boost to Europe.  The euro came very close to the 1.07/$ mark, bund yields surged more than 20 basis points and the European Stoxx 600 benchmark propelled 1.6% higher.

Von Der Leyen also said that the EU will propose activating a fiscal escape clause, which could allow countries to use their national budgets to spend an additional €650 billion on defense over four years without triggering budgetary penalties.

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Lizzy Burden.

doPyK5zd9S4,Defense Stocks Surge: EU Leaders Commit to Ukraine Support | The Opening Trade 03/03,"Markets are starting the week with geopolitics dominating as European leaders assemble what Britain called a “coalition of the willing” to secure Ukraine following an Oval Office clash between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The euro gained and defense stocks rallied as a concerted push by European leaders fueled bets on a wave of military spending. Defense stocks soared, boosting the market capitalization of the sector by about $30 billion in Monday’s session as BAE Systems, Rheinmetall and SAAB rose higher. In crypto markets, Bitcoin retreated, trimming a Sunday rally spurred by President Donald Trump’s comments on a strategic crypto reserve. 

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Lizzy Burden.

WPgIAhhSWkE,"Market Selloff: Bitcoin Down 25% From All-Time High, Tesla Sinks | The Opening Trade 02/28/2025","European equities dropped, tracking Asian shares lower, as US President Donald Trump’s latest pronouncements on trade tariffs drained investor appetite for riskier assets. Bitcoin plunged, extending declines from its January peak to over 25%. Regardless of how Friday turns out, February has been a terrible month for Tesla, with the stock dropping 14 of the 19 trading days in the month, including the past six straight. Trump said 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would come into force from March 4, while Chinese imports would face a further 10% levy. Economists say tariffs may hurt US growth, worsen inflation and possibly spark recessions in Mexico and Canada. China vowed “all necessary measures” against the US moves.

Z_aiqEACAXU,"European Stocks Tumble After Nvidia Results, Trump's 25% EU Tariff Plan | The Opening Trade 02/27","European stocks dropped after US President Donald Trump said he would impose 25% tariffs on imports from the European Union. The Stoxx 600 index fell 0.5%, with the retail, tech and auto sectors falling the most. Trump gave contradictory statements Wednesday on the implementation of tariffs, keeping investors guessing. A White House official said the European levies could affect all exports from the block or only specific sectors. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the center of an AI spending boom, is in focus after it delivered good-but-not-great earnings Wednesday, drawing a muted response from investors accustomed to blowout numbers.

AuubA94ucf0,"'Gold Card' Trump Visas, Ukraine Said to Agree on Minerals Deal with US | The Opening Trade 02/26","President Donald Trump said he is starting a program to offer residency and a path to citizenship to investors who pay $5 million, offering a new avenue for legal immigration even as he carries out a sweeping crackdown on undocumented migrants. Trump said the program, dubbed the “gold card,” would launch in two weeks. Ukraine agreed with the US to jointly develop its wealth of natural resources as part of a deal that could ease tension with President Donald Trump and advance his administration’s goal of a ceasefire with Russia, people familiar with the matter said. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is planning to travel to the US Friday to seal the accord, the people said.

Jrgd_1ZahR8,"Bitcoin Sinks Below $90,000, US to Intensify Chip Controls Over China | The Opening Trade 02/25","Bitcoin tumbled below $90,000 to hit the lowest since mid-November, as the rally that followed Donald Trump’s election to the White House reverses under the weight of his trade tariffs and a string of industry setbacks. Trump's administration is planning to expand efforts to limit China from developing a domestic semiconductor industry that could boost its AI and military capabilities. ASML and STMicroelectronics shares fell as US President Donald Trump spelled out more measures to curb China’s semiconductor industry and urged allies to the same. Nvidia’s earnings report on Wednesday could be yet another catalyst to unleash volatility given its outsized impact on the broader market.

ZfCzNpPbqHs,"CDU/CSU's Merz Wins German Election, AfD Sees Historic Gains | The Opening Trade 02/24","The euro rose and German mid-cap stocks rallied on speculation that Germany’s election results may pave the way for more spending to boost economic growth. Germany’s conservative leader Friedrich Merz emerged as the winner, but the results gave his bloc just one clear path to power with intense pressure to form a government.  While Merz’s CDU/CSU alliance won 28.6% of the votes, the only centrist two-party option for a majority in the Bundestag is to partner with Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s battered Social Democrats. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, doubled support to become the second-strongest party with 20.8%, it's highest percentage in over a decade.

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Kriti Gupta and Lizzy Burden.

1-IQGZE_j5I,German Election Countdown: Pollsters Struggle to Predict Outcome | The Opening Trade 02/21,"Voter surveys gauging support for Germany’s political parties have proved relatively accurate in past elections and barely budged over the three-month campaign leading into Sunday’s ballot. Pollsters are still nervous there might be a surprise. A number of unpredictable factors are at play this time that could impact the outcome, according to officials from polling institutes interviewed by Bloomberg. Tactical voting might shift results in a similar way to last year’s regional elections, where some centrist voters switched to the likely winner in a bid to counter the far-right Alternative for Germany.

nHgzpAU7MTY,"Trump Calls Zelenskiy 'Dictator', UK's Starmer Backs Zelenskiy | The Opening Trade 02/20","President Donald Trump’s social media post denouncing Zelenskiy as “a modestly successful comedian” and “a dictator” marks an all-but-final rejection of Ukraine as a full partner in negotiations that Trump has initiated with Russia to end the war that began with President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of his neighbor three years ago. Trump abandons years of American support for Ukraine, as he prepares to meet with Putin as soon as this month to negotiate a deal to end the war. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer repeated his support for Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a call with the Ukrainian president on Wednesday. Starmer “stressed the need for everyone to work together,” according to a readout of the call issued by Downing Street, and said it was “perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War II.” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reiterated said “there must be no decision over the heads of Ukraine,” while Starmer said he was prepared to put troops on the ground as part of a peacekeeping force.

UNe2isODuv4,"Trump Floats 25% Tariffs on Imports, UK Inflation at 10-Month High | Opening Trade 02/19","President Donald Trump said he would likely impose tariffs on automobile, semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports of around 25%, with an announcement coming as soon as April 2 in a move that would represent a dramatic widening of the president’s trade war. UK inflation climbed to the highest level in 10 months in January, boosted by the cost of airfares, motor fuel, food and the imposition of value-added tax on private school fees. Consumer prices increased 3% from a year earlier, accelerating from a 2.5% pace in December, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday.

Europe’s Stoxx 600 index was steady after Monday’s rally, though defense stocks surged further, with Rheinmetall, SAAB and Dassault Aviation reaching new record highs. The war in Ukraine continues to dominate markets in Europe as traders await details on new defense funding measures and officials in the region fume after being excluded from US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia.

ATmB8G2HKJ8,Defense Stocks Surge as Trump & Putin Teams Head to Saudi Arabia | The Opening Trade 02/17,"Top US and Russian government officials will hold a meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss the restoration of bilateral ties and ending the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin confirmed on Monday. European bonds fell and shares in defense companies rallied on the likelihood of greater military spending. Officials are working on a major new package to ramp up defense spending and some EU leaders are planning to meet on Monday in Paris to start drawing up their response. The moves come as the US pushes for a quick end to the war in Ukraine and after Vice President JD Vance attacked longstanding European allies at a security conference Friday.

CwMys3fqkpk,Trump Wants to Meet Putin & China's Xi to Cut Military Budgets in Half | The Opening Trade 02/14,"President Donald Trump floated the idea of a three-way meeting with the leaders of Russia and China in which the countries would agree to cut defense spending in half. Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Thursday, suggested repeatedly that he’d seek such a deal with Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, saying the money could be spent better elsewhere. “One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia,” Trump said. “And I want to say, ‘let’s cut our military budget in half.’ Trump also ordered his administration to consider imposing reciprocal tariffs on numerous trading partners, raising the prospect of a wider campaign against a global system he complains is tilted against the US. Trump signed a measure directing the US Trade Representative and Commerce secretary to propose new levies on a country-by-country basis in an effort to rebalance trade relations.

ysRUkutRO7I,"Putin, Trump Agree to Ukraine Talks in US Policy Reversal | The Opening Trade 02/13","President Donald Trump agreed in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin to start negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, sweeping aside three years of US policy and blindsiding European allies who feared the more conciliatory American stance amounted to a giveaway to the Russian leader. The euro rose and European stocks rallied to a record on optimism that US-Russia talks could end the Ukraine war. The combined currency climbed as much as 0.6%, extending its longest winning streak this year as prospects for an end to the conflict boosted appetite for riskier assets. The dollar retreated, oil fell further on speculation that risks to Russian supply may ease, and Ukraine dollar bonds rose the most among emerging-market peers. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

Ip4Vj_1IzmM,"US, UK Fail to Sign Macron’s AI Summit Declaration in Paris | The Opening Trade 02/12","The US and UK declined to sign the final statement released Tuesday from the AI Summit hosted by France that called for promoting international governance over artificial intelligence. In a speech before the communique was released, Vice President JD Vance argued against the EU’s regulatory approach to social media platforms and AI and what he termed as foreign governments “considering tightening the screws” on US tech companies. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesperson, Dave Pares, told reporters on Tuesday that while the UK had worked “closely” with the French throughout the summit, they hadn’t been able to agree on all parts of the leaders’ declaration. China, as well as summit co-host India, were among the 60 countries and organizations that signed.

roJOdSmBuLY,"Tariffs: EU Threatens Countermeasures After Trump's Action on Steel, Aluminum","The European Union said it will respond to any tariffs the US might impose on it, escalating a potential transatlantic trade dispute. “Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered — they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. On Monday US President Donald Trump ordered a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports. Bloomberg's Oliver Crook reports.

OBWNnANDe7U,"Trump Plans to Impose 25% Tariffs on Steel, Aluminum Imports | The Opening Trade 02/10","President Donald Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum into the US, broadening his trade restrictions to some of the country’s top trading partners and seeking to protect domestic industries that helped him win battleground states last year. Many steel and aluminum buyers and sellers had expected they would have at least until March to prepare for any tariff implementation. Both sides will now have to scramble to find new markets and suppliers.

IScA99kxZ5c,"Trump Aides Defend Gaza Takeover Proposal, Bank of England Rate Cut Bets | The Opening Trade 02/06","Aides to President Donald Trump sought to tone down his idea of depopulating and taking over Gaza after his suggestion that the US would “own” the war-ravaged territory was welcomed in Israel but widely condemned elsewhere. No one, including Israel, was expecting Trump’s public suggestion on Tuesday that his country step in and rebuild the coastal Palestinian territory, creating what he called a new “Riviera.” The Bank of England is expected to cut interest rates for a third time on Thursday while downgrading its UK growth forecasts and predicting higher inflation this year in a report that will make uncomfortable reading for Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves. Economists and traders expect the Monetary Policy Committee to press ahead with a quarter-point reduction in its benchmark rate to 4.5%, the lowest level since June 2023. A survey by Bloomberg suggests the vote will be split 8-1 in favor of a cut. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

The Japanese carmakers had been negotiating the terms of a tie-up under which Honda would offer Nissan a lifeline by absorbing its struggling rival, and bring the two brands under a single holding company in 2026.

fMnK67Q1nDU,"China Retaliates to Trump Tariffs, Palantir Stock Surges on AI Demand | The Opening Trade 02/04","China retaliated to Donald Trump’s opening trade war tariffs by targeting a handful of American companies and slapping levies on some US goods, in a move seemingly designed to avoid escalating tensions between the world’s biggest economies. Beijing imposed a 15% levy on less than $5 billion of US energy imports and a moderate 10% fee on American oil and agricultural equipment on Tuesday, moments after new US tariffs entered effect. China said it will also investigate Google for alleged antitrust violations, although Alphabet Inc.’s search services have been unavailable in the country since 2010. Palantir shares jumped after giving a full-year revenue forecast that exceeded analysts’ estimates, thanks to what Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp described as “untamed organic growth” in demand for its artificial intelligence software. Sales will be about $3.75 billion in 2025, the Denver-based company said Monday in a statement.

The targets are unlikely ones: Canada and Mexico, the two biggest buyers of US goods. Trump has pledged 25% tariffs on about $900 billion in goods from both nations, whose trade surpluses with the US have long chafed the president. Trump on Thursday vowed to follow through by his self-imposed Feb. 1 deadline, though the mercurial president has been known to change his mind.

paYlt9QpfPY,"Nvidia Calls DeepSeek ‘Excellent’ AI Advance, Trump's New Tariff Vow | The Opening Trade 01/28","Nvidia, the biggest provider of chips used to train artificial intelligence software, said a new model released by Chinese startup DeepSeek is an “excellent AI advancement” that complies with US technology export controls. After more than quintupling in the past two years, Nvidia’s shares plummeted Monday in one of the biggest selloffs in history, on concern that DeepSeek’s offering reduces the need for the expensive type of hardware that the US chip company offers. President Donald Trump said he wants to impose across-the-board tariffs that are “much bigger” than 2.5%, the latest in a string of signals that he’s preparing widespread levies to reshape US supply chains. He also strongly suggested he could also impose them on automobiles from Canada and Mexico, countries he’s already threatened with 25% across-the board tariffs as soon as Feb. 1.

2zj1jPiVZcI,"China's DeepSeek AI Rocks Global Tech Stocks, Bitcoin Slips Below $100K | The Opening Trade 01/27","Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rocked global technology stocks Monday, raising questions over America’s technological dominance.
Buzz grew over the weekend about DeepSeek’s latest AI model being cost-effective while running on less-advanced chips, as the product has now rocketed to the top of Apple’s iPhone download charts. In Europe, tech stocks led market losses, with shares of chip equipment maker ASML fell more than 8%. Bitcoin dipped as traders booked profits just days after President Donald Trump’s executive order identified the digital-assets industry as a crucial driver of US innovation.
The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

J-gWeMReSek,"Elon Musk's Boeing Scrutiny, Trump Reconsiders China Tariffs | The Opening Trade 01/24","President Donald Trump says he would prefer not to impose tariffs on China, citing tariffs as a ""tremendous power"" over the country. Despite his softer tone, analysts believe Trump is unlikely to back down from his tariff threats, with a lot at stake for China and the global economy. Billionaire Elon Musk scrutinized the red tape entangling the Air Force One revamp in late December, according to people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, Boeing suffered another quarter of fresh charges and losses as the company announced sales at $15.2 billion, less than the $16.76 billion expected by Wall Street. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

KW8Yut8aC5E,"Elon Musk, Sam Altman Clash Over Trump's Stargate AI Plan | The Opening Trade 01/23","Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump’s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House. Trump was joined by SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Oracle's Larry Ellison at the White House to announce the venture, dubbed Stargate, which they said would deploy $100 billion immediately with the goal of eventually spending $500 billion for the construction of data centers and physical campuses. Altman took to X to dispute Musk’s characterization on Wednesday, calling it wrong and suggesting Musk was upset because the pact could rival the billionaire’s own AI efforts.

Debt interest costs pushed up UK government borrowing more than predicted last month, putting Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves on course to overshoot official forecasts this year. Despite a faltering economy and backlash against approving controversial projects aimed at boosting growth, Reeves claimed the UK’s public finances are “now in order,” said no promises can be made regarding cutting the tax burden, and is “absolutely” relaxed about wealth creation.

A later post from her suggested differences remain in how to approach key issues like migration. French bond risk rises to 2012 levels due to political standoff over the country's budget as Prime Minister Michel Barnier's ability to pass a budget and enact spending cuts remains in doubt. The potential fall of the government could drive bond risk higher, with some strategists predicting a spread of 100 basis points or more.

The indictment accuses Adani, his nephew, and another executive of breaking federal laws, and the Adani Group's stocks and bonds plummeted, wiping nearly $30 billion off its market value.

KzvSbp1jOso,US Election: 1 Day Left | The Opening Trade 11/04,"A flurry of polls released Sunday show Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump remain poised for a photo finish in this week’s presidential election. Additionally, the dollar fell as investors walked back bets on Donald Trump winning the US presidential election after weekend polls indicated Kamala Harris was gaining ground. Oil advanced after OPEC+ agreed to push back its December production increase by one month and tensions escalated again in the Middle East after Iran escalated its rhetoric against Israel.  The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe.

40hvEuzbkRk,"French Markets Digest Barnier’s Budget, Elon Musk Unveils Tesla Robotaxi | The Opening Trade 10/11","Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s plan to raise taxes on the rich could prompt some to move out of France and others who might have been considering settling in the country to cancel their plans, according to wealth and tax advisers. Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled a slick two-seat sedan called Cybercab late Thursday, saying production may start in 2026 and that the vehicle could cost less than $30,000.  Gold pared a weekly decline, after hotter-than-expected inflation and a slowdown in the labor market amplified debate over the size of the Federal Reserve’s expected interest rate cut next month. The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.

T-3sZs2YqoU,ECB Rate Path in Question as Powell Signals Cut | The Opening Trade 08/26,"Stocks paused on Monday as rising tension in the Middle East tempered the bullish sentiment sparked by the prospect of imminent Fed rate cuts. STOXX 600 index was little changed at the open on Monday, with liquidity lower than usual as UK markets are closed for a holiday. Meanwhile, ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane, cautioned that the benchmark rate “will have to remain in restrictive territory for as long as is needed to shepherd the disinflation process towards a timely return to target.” Lane's comment comes after Fed Chair Jay Powell said the “time has come” for the Fed to lower benchmark rates from their two-decade high, his clearest signal yet that long-awaited rate cuts are imminent.

X7JXJXHII1s,France Election: Are Round One Results Good for Markets?,"Sebastian Raedler, head of European equity strategy at Bank of America, discusses the outlook for risk premia in Europe after the first round of voting in France's legislative election showed Marine Le Pen’s far-right party winning by a smaller margin than some polls projected. ""It's hard to argue that you've got a good outcome,"" Raedler said on Bloomberg Television. ""Maybe you block a majority by the hard right. But in the best case scenario, you get a hung parliament. That effectively means very little decision making, no ability to deal with a very wide budget deficit, and also the European integration story effectively put on hold.""
