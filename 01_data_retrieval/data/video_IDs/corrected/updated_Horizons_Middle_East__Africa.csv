mHe3PozZccc,"Trump Tariffs Spark Fear of Liquidity Crisis in Lesotho, Trade Minister Warns","Lesotho is at risk of a liquidity crisis if US President Donald Trump follows through on plans to impose a 50% levy on imports from the tiny southern African mountain kingdom, Trade Minister Mokhethi Shelile warned. “We will be terribly affected,” he told Bloomberg's Jennifer Zabasajja. Trump announced he’ll apply tariffs of at least 10% on most goods coming into America, with even higher duties on some 60 nations, to counter trade imbalances. Lesotho was hit with the highest levies on the continent before the US president paused the additional duties for 90 days.
