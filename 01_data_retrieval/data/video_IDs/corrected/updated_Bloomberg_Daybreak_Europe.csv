jtG1WeuDBuM,"Tesla Denies Looking To Replace Musk & US, Ukraine Sign Resources Deal | Daybreak Europe 05/01/2025","Bloomberg Daybreak Europe is your essential morning viewing to stay ahead. Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.

On today's show, Microsoft and Meta shares surging in late trading after the tech giants reported better-than-expected earnings. 

Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm pushed back against a report the board was looking to replace CEO Elon Musk, saying directors are “highly confident” in his ability. The rebuke came after the Wall Street Journal said that board members contacted executive search companies about a month ago to hunt for a successor to Musk, as investors fretted about the amount of time he was devoting to his US government role.

Meanwhile, the US and Ukraine have signed a deal over access to the nation's natural resources. Kyiv hopes the agreement will secure President Trump's support in ceasefire talks with Russia.

Elsewhere, US President Donald Trump’s administration has been seeking contact with Beijing to initiate talks on the massive tariffs Washington has imposed on China, according to a state-run media outlet.

nkhYH9UQJe4,Trump Initiates Chips and Drug Probes Ahead of More Tariffs | Daybreak: Europe 04/15/2025,"Bloomberg Daybreak Europe is your essential morning viewing to stay ahead. Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.

On today's show, shares in automakers rise after President Trump said he is exploring temporary tariff exemptions to give auto companies more time to set up US manufacturing. However, his administration presses forward with trade probes on pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports - a precursor to potential levies. In an exclusive interview with Bloomberg, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismisses speculation that foreign governments are selling off US debt following the recent rout in treasuries.

Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.

On today's show, US Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, is dropping his threat to block a Republican spending bill. The move opens the way to avoid a US government shutdown on Saturday. The European Union's foreign policy chief has underlined the bloc's readiness to retaliate on US tariffs, while at the same time, calling for restraint. This comes after President Trump threatened a 200% tariff on all wines, champagnes and alcoholic products from the EU if the bloc goes through with a retaliatory 50% levy on American whiskey. Meanwhile, Russian President Putin says he supports the idea of the US-brokered Ukraine truce deal but wants to discuss the details with President Trump.

Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.

On today's show, President Donald Trump has defended his use of tariffs in a primetime presidential address to a joint session of Congress.
Trump warned of 'a little disturbance' from the levies, after his tariffs against the US's largest trading partners sent markets swinging. This as China has set its economic growth goal at about five percent for 2025, amid the opening salvo of a trade war with the US. Premier Li Qiang announced the target at the meeting of the National People's Congress, one day after President Trump doubled tariffs on China. Meanwhile, Europe's biggest economy is taking a major step to bolster its defense capabilities. Berlin is amending its constitution to exempt defense and security outlays from limits on fiscal spending. 

Today's Guests: Laura Wang, Chief China Equity Strategist at Morgan Stanley & Ravi Mhatre, Co-founder and Partner at Lightspeed.

Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.
On today's show, Elon Musk appears to have turned on Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage, a friend of Donald Trump who he previously supported. The billionaire posted on X, 'The Reform Party needs a new leader. Farage doesn't have what it takes.'
Meanwhile, Canada's Globe and Mail says Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, is expected to announce as early as this week that he's resining. And Austria's anti-immigrant Freedom Party is creeping closer to appointing its first chancellor after receiving an invitation by the nation's president to discuss forming a government.

2XQDkrV1E0E,US Treasury Hacked by China-Backed Attackers | Daybreak: Europe 12/31/2024,"Bloomberg Daybreak Europe is your essential morning viewing to stay ahead. Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins. 
On today's show, The US Treasury Department was hacked by a Chinese state-sponsored actor through a third-party software service provider, according to a letter the agency sent to Congress on Monday.
Treasury described the intrusion as a “major cybersecurity incident,” since it was attributed to a state-sponsored actor, according to the letter, which was reviewed by Bloomberg News.
Treasury was notified on Dec. 8 by a third-party software provider, BeyondTrust Inc., that a hacker had gained access “to a key used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support for Treasury Departmental Offices (DO) end users,” according to the letter. 
The department is being assisted by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the FBI, the intelligence community and third-party forensic investigators.
Based on available information, advanced hackers tied to China were behind the incident, according to the letter.
The Chinese embassy in Washington opposes US “smear attacks against China without any factual basis,” it said in an emailed statement.

Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins. 
On  today's show, President Joe Biden’s administration is launching an investigation that will offer President-elect Donald Trump a choice about whether to enact new tariffs on Chinese-made semiconductor chips.
The White House announced Monday it would initiate the inquiry into so-called foundational chips — also known as legacy or mature-node semiconductors — made in China. While not as advanced as the chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous across a wide range of applications including autos, airplanes, medical devices and the telecommunications industry.

t1iRlNImupI,Trump Says Talk of Ceding Presidency to Elon Musk Is a ‘Hoax’ | Daybreak: Europe 12/23/2024,"Bloomberg Daybreak Europe is your essential morning viewing to stay ahead. Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins. 
On today's show, Panama’s president rebuffed Donald Trump’s threat to reimpose US control over the Panama Canal, saying its shipping tolls aren’t inflated and that sovereignty over the waterway isn’t negotiable.
Elsewhere, Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. are looking to finalize a merger agreement as soon as June after negotiations begin later Monday, and may combine in 2026, Japanese media reported, citing unidentified sources.
The two automakers plan to create a holding company that would be helmed by a president picked by Honda, Japanese broadcaster NHK said. A press briefing is expected Monday afternoon after the companies hold board meetings.
In other news,  Donald Trump said Sunday that he will be president of the US — not Elon Musk. 
“No, he’s not taking the presidency,” Trump told a conservative audience in Phoenix, addressing growing complaints about the outsized role the Tesla boss has already had in his incoming administration.
“You know, they’re on a new kick,” he said. “All the different hoaxes. The new one is that President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon Musk. No, no, that’s not happening.”
That Trump would be compelled to address Musk’s power is testimony to the unusual influence that the world’s richest man has displayed in a second Trump presidency that won’t begin for another month.

iOuAPI_3Mlg,"Israel Kills Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar, US Pushes for Truce in Gaza | Daybreak: Europe 10/18/24","Bloomberg Daybreak Europe is your essential morning viewing to stay ahead. Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.
Today's guests: Niamh McBurney, Control Risks Associate Director for MENA, and Agate Freimane, Norrsken VC General Partner.
On today's show, Israeli soldiers killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the Oct. 7 attack, in a death that leaves a huge hole at the top of the militant group and spurred fresh US pressure for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war in the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli military said Sinwar, who hadn’t been heard from in weeks, was slain Wednesday in southern Gaza along with two other Hamas militants in what appeared to be a chance encounter with the mastermind of the deadliest attack on Israeli soil.

Elsewhere, LVMH’s sales of fashion and leather goods fell for the first time since the pandemic as the industry’s biggest player was hammered by a slump in demand from Chinese consumers whose appetite for high-end purchases once seemed insatiable.
That was the worst quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2020 when the world went into lockdown. Overall, the group’s sales slid 3%.

jmsieL4Btjg,"Netanyahu Agrees to Limit Strike on Iran, US Weighs AI Chip Sale Limit | Daybreak: Europe 10/15/2024","Bloomberg Daybreak Europe is your essential morning viewing to stay ahead. Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.
Today's guests: Anna Titareva, UBS Investment Bank European Economist, and Simon Bumfrey, HSBC Innovation Bank Technology & Life Sciences Head.
Israel said it is listening to US misgivings about its planned counter-strike against Iran but will act based on its own assessments, following a report suggesting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could spare Tehran’s nuclear and energy facilities.
The statement came after a report in the Washington Post saying Netanyahu agreed to limit his retaliation for an Oct. 1 Iranian ballistic missile salvo to military targets. The report cited two officials familiar with the matter whom it didn’t identify.

51e8GM5x6Ew,US to Send Missile Defenses to Israel as Hezbollah Launch Drone Attack | Daybreak: Europe 10/14/2024,"Bloomberg Daybreak Europe is your essential morning viewing to stay ahead. Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.
On today's show, The US is sending an advanced missile defense system and associated troops to Israel to help shield its ally from attacks by Iran, the Pentagon announced.
Deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense battery will buttress Israel’s own air defenses, which were stretched by Iranian attacks at least twice this year, most recently by some 200 missiles fired at Israeli targets on Oct. 1. 
Elsewhere, SpaceX made big strides on its path to creating a rocket capable of flying to the moon and Mars, completing a journey to space with its Starship that included catching the vehicle’s booster back at the launchpad using mechanical arms.

we16tYgVO5Q,Israel Considers Range of Retaliation Options on Iran | Daybreak: Europe 10/03/2024,"Bloomberg Daybreak Europe is your essential morning viewing to stay ahead. Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.
Today's guest: Yam Taw Boon, Neuberger Berman Head of Thematic Asia & Portfolio Manager.
On today's show, we cover the story of the US president Joe Biden said Israel should hold off from attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities in retaliation for a missile barrage this week, as Group of Seven nations sought to tamp down a spiraling conflict that threatens to pull the US even deeper in. 
Asked if he would support such a response, which some Israeli politicians have called for, Biden responded, “The answer is no.” He said he was set to speak with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and the G-7 planned a statement in an effort to head off further escalation, while further sanctions will be imposed on Iran.
Elsewhere,  OpenAI has completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, giving the artificial intelligence company a $157 billion valuation and bolstering its efforts to build the world’s leading generative AI technology.  
The funding round was led by Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm headed up by Josh Kushner, which put in $1.3 billion. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI’s largest backer, put in about $750 million, on top of the $13 billion it had already invested in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Other investors included Khosla Ventures, Fidelity Management & Research Co. and Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker whose powerful processors are at the center of the AI boom. Microsoft declined to comment.

On today's show, Israel said it had begun “targeted ground raids” in southern Lebanon, escalating a campaign to root out Hezbollah despite international appeals for restraint.
The Israel Defense Forces said early Tuesday its forces are striking targets “located in villages close to the border” that “pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel.”
Elsewhere, Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida resigned with his Cabinet on Tuesday, paving the way for his likely successor Shigeru Ishiba to take office. Kishida took office in 2021 but is leaving so his party can have a fresh leader after his government was dogged by scandals.
