3RpNwD99yaI,China Hints at Possible US Thaw After Trump Tariff Hikes | Bloomberg The Pulse 05/02,"China said it is assessing the possibility of trade talks with the US, the first sign since Donald Trump hiked tariffs last month that negotiations could begin between the two sides. China’s Commerce Ministry said in a Friday statement that it had noted senior US officials repeatedly expressing their willingness to talk to Beijing about tariffs, and urged officials in Washington to show “sincerity” toward China. “The US has recently sent messages to China through relevant parties, hoping to start talks with China,” the ministry added. “China is currently evaluating this.”

In corporate news, Amazon and Apple disappointed on their earnings results. Tech companies are sounding the alarm on the potential downside impact of US tariffs enacted by Trump.

LzSYan2iznM,"Musk Future: Tesla Denies New CEO Search; US, Ukraine Sign Minerals Deal | Bloomberg The Pulse 05/01","Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm denied a report that the board had looked to replace Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, saying directors are “highly confident” in his ability. “Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company,” Denholm posted to Tesla’s X account. “This is absolutely false.” The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Tesla board members had contacted executive search firms to seek a successor to Musk earlier this year, citing people familiar with the discussions.

In geopolitics, the US and Ukraine reached a deal over access to the country’s natural resources. The deal will grant the US privileged access to new investment projects to develop Ukraine’s natural resources including aluminum, graphite, oil and natural gas. It’s been seen as critical to fostering Trump’s goodwill as his administration pushes to end the war that began when Russia mounted its full-scale invasion more than three years ago.

SPW-GVgUqc8,"Amazon Denies Tariff Label Plan, Trump Says China to 'Eat' Tariffs  | Bloomberg The Pulse 04/30","Amazon said Tuesday it will not display the cost of US tariffs on products after the White House blasted the reported move and President Donald Trump called Jeff Bezos to complain. “The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store has considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products,” the company said in a statement.

US President Donald Trump renewed criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell as he championed his economic policies and tariff regime during a Tuesday event to mark his 100th day in office. “Inflation is basically down and interest rates came down despite the fact that I have a Fed person who’s not really doing a good job,” Trump said. Polls show voters are wary of Trump’s economic agenda and worried that the tariffs could tip the economy into a recession and spike consumer prices. Consumer confidence in April hit a five-year low.

CjXQTRyORew,Canada Election: Carney Warns Trump 'Trying to Break Us' as Liberals Win | Bloomberg The Pulse 04/29,"Canada’s Liberal Party is projected to win a fourth consecutive election, giving a mandate to former central banker Mark Carney after a campaign in which he pledged to boost economic growth and stand up to US President Donald Trump in a trade war. The margin of victory appears to be narrow. Liberal candidates were leading or elected in 167 seats, ahead of the Conservative Party’s 145 seats, as of 3:15 a.m. Ottawa time on Tuesday morning. Carney, 60, tried to establish quickly that he was different from his predecessor, Justin Trudeau — more focused on the economy and on building new trade and security alliances, given the new foreign policy coming from Washington. His first steps were to cancel some of Trudeau’s less popular policies, such as a carbon tax on consumers, and to visit two European allies, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

nxq2ufgRVN0,"Trump China Tariffs to Unleash US Supply Shock; Shein, Temu Hike Prices | Bloomberg The Pulse 04/28","President Donald Trump’s tariff onslaught has roiled Washington and Wall Street for nearly a month. If the trade war persists, the next upheaval will hit much closer to home.Since the US raised levies on China to 145% in early April, cargo shipments have plummeted, perhaps by as much as 60%, according to one estimate. That drastic reduction in goods from one of the largest US trading partners hasn’t been felt by many Americans yet, but that’s about to change. By the middle of May, thousands of companies — big and small — will be needing to replenish inventories. Giant retailers such as Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. told Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices. Meanwhile fast-fashion giant Shein has raised US prices of its products from dresses to kitchenware ahead of imminent tariffs on small parcels, while discount Chinese retail app Temu appears to be passing on nearly all of Donald Trump’s new import taxes to US consumers, more than doubling the cost of some products in a move that may add to concern about the inflationary impact of tariffs.

Authorities are considering removing the additional levies for medical equipment and some industrial chemicals like ethane, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private deliberations. Meanwhile President Donald Trump said his administration was talking with China on trade, after Beijing denied the existence of negotiations on a deal and demanded the US revoke all unilateral tariffs.

vov9pCA4K44,"China Says US Should Revoke Unilateral Tariffs, Russia Attacks Ukraine  | Bloomberg The Pulse 04/24","A global rally in equities stalled as investors scaled back their expectations of quick progress in the US-China tariff dispute. Stocks in Europe dropped after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cast doubt on a timely resolution to the trade war, while Beijing said the two sides aren’t in talks. China also demanded that the US revoke all unilateral tariffs, maintaining a tough stance despite US President Donald Trump’s easing of criticism of the country. The remarks suggest that President Donald Trump’s comments this week signaling that he could lower tariffs on China — which currently stand at 145% for most goods — will not be enough to de-escalate tensions. Meanwhile Russia hit Ukraine with a barrage of missiles and drones overnight, killing at least nine people in the capital, even as President Trump ratcheted up pressure on Kyiv to accept a peace deal.

-evmHG7MrnQ,Trump Floats Cutting China Tariffs ‘Substantially’ in Trade Deal | Bloomberg The Pulse 04/23,"US President Donald Trump said he plans to be “very nice” to China in any trade talks and that tariffs will drop if the two countries can reach a deal. “It will come down substantially but it won’t be zero,” Trump said Tuesday in Washington, following earlier comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the standoff was unsustainable. Trump added that “we’re going to be very nice and they’re going to be very nice, and we’ll see what happens.”

US stock futures also advanced and the US dollar strengthened after Trump said he had no intention of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell despite his frustration with the central bank not moving more quickly to slash interest rates. “Never did,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday. “The press runs away with things. No, I have no intention of firing him. I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates.”

DecdCcijzso,Tariffs Latest: Trump Says ‘Big Progress’ Made in Japan Talks | Bloomberg The Pulse 04/17,"US President Donald Trump says “big progress” was made in his meeting with a Japanese trade delegation. Tokyo's top negotiator says more talks will take place this month. 

Hermes shares dropped after the French luxury-goods maker's first-quarter sales slightly undershot analyst estimates, stoking worries that even companies exposed to the wealthiest clients could be susceptible to a slowdown in demand for high-end items. The company will increase prices in the US as of May 1 to compensate for the impact of new tariffs. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s net income and gross margin beat estimates. The world's biggest chipmaker also kept its growth outlook for 2025 on expectations of AI revenue doubling, despite growing trade worries.

B1clJRJVgcY,Trade War: China Open To Talks With US If Trump Shows Respect | Bloomberg The Pulse 04/16,"Bloomberg has learned that China wants to see a number of steps from President Trump's administration before it will agree to trade talks, including showing more respect by reining in disparaging remarks by members of his cabinet. Other conditions include a more consistent US position and a willingness to address China's concerns around American sanctions and Taiwan. Beijing also wants the US to appoint a point person for talks who has the president's support and can help prepare a deal that Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping can sign when they meet. 

Meanwhile, semiconductors stocks dropping in premarket trading on Wednesday after Nvidia said the US government is restricting the export of its H20 chip to China. The sector was also weighed down after ASML reported quarterly bookings well estimates.

-JtvFpIbbMU,Trump Warns Tariffs Coming for Electronics After Reprieve | Bloomberg The Pulse 04/14,"Global technology stocks climbed on Monday after the Trump administration provided crucial albeit fleeting tariff relief for battered electronics and semiconductor makers. The administration on Friday exempted phones, computers and chips from its so-called reciprocal tariffs. But the President added that no-one is 'off the hook,' pledging that he will still apply tariffs to popular consumer electronics — making the reprieve seem temporary and part of the longstanding plan to apply a different, specific levy to the sector. 

This comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping has started his sweep across Southeast Asia with a visit to one of the countries hardest hit by the shakeup of global trade: Vietnam. Xi Jinping's trip is seen as an attempt to form alliances against the US in the trade war. 

Meanwhile, Bloomberg understands that the US and Iran are expected to hold their second round of nuclear talks on Saturday in Rome. It follows their first meeting in years in Oman over the weekend.

joGA5HDxX8U,Trump's Tariffs Go Into Effect As China Holds Fire On Immediate Retaliation | Bloomberg The Pulse,"President Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs kicked in after countries failed to secure a last-minute reprieve. He imposed levies on China as high as 104% along with import taxes on roughly 60 trading partners. China held off on immediate retaliation to the new tariffs after hitting back within minutes in February and March. 

Meanwhile, treasuries extended their declines and European stocks plunged after Trump hiked trade tariffs to a 100-year high. The yield on 30-year Treasuries surged to the highest since November 2023 amid growing doubts about the haven status of US sovereign bonds. Europe's stock benchmark fell more than 3%. Oil sank to a fresh four-year low.

DUnGsX28YSU,Trump Tariffs Send Global Stocks into Freefall Again | Bloomberg The Pulse 04/07,"The stampede from global equities gathered momentum Monday and investors piled into haven assets as the fallout from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs deepened. European stocks tumbled on Monday morning, approaching a bear market. President Trump and his economic team dismissed investors’ fears of inflation and recession, offering no apologies for the market turmoil and defiantly insisting a boom is on the horizon. Trump, speaking Sunday on Air Force One, struck a determined tone and repeatedly defended the tariff barrage unveiled last week. He also drew something of a line in the sand, saying he wouldn’t strike deals to cut the highest tariffs unless they eliminate the US trade deficit with that country.

OFL1m-5ftT4,Trump Seeks ‘Phenomenal’ Tariff Offers as Markets Tumble| Bloomberg The Pulse 04/04,"Stocks slid further, adding to losses after a $2.5 trillion wipeout of US equities and putting MSCI’s global benchmark on track for the biggest weekly loss in seven months. Treasuries rallied while, the dollar has wiped out all of its gains since Donald Trump won the presidency in November as a new wave of tariffs upended global markets. 

Trump said he was open to reducing his tariffs if other nations were able to offer something “phenomenal,” Speaking on Air Force One on Thursday, Trump broadly defended his tariff program despite a stock market meltdown, saying he was happy that interest rates were falling and believed that the economic turbulence would settle. “The tariffs give us great power to negotiate,” Trump said, adding that “every country has called us,” he said.

2afepOvct-c,"Trump Tariffs Hurt US Dollar as China, EU Vow Response | Bloomberg The Pulse 03/25","Global financial markets were hit by a sweeping selloff after President Donald Trump’s bid to remake the world trading order proved more aggressive than expected. Footwear and apparel companies such as Adidas AG and Puma SE fell almost 10% as hefty tariffs on Vietnam and other critical production hubs threatened their supply chains. Asian stocks posted heavy losses earlier in the day, with Tokyo’s Nikkei index losing almost 3%. US assets were among the worst affected, with futures on the S&P 500 slumping almost 3% and Bloomberg’s dollar index dropping more than 1% to a five-month low. Big US technology names were among the biggest losers in premarket trading with Apple down more than 6$, Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla all fell more than 3%. Gold hit new highs amid investors’ flight to haven assets, while 10-year Treasury yields dropped to the lowest level in more than five months and the yen strengthened.

3FuK2AOLadI,"Trump Tariffs: What It Means for US Economy, World Trade | Bloomberg The Pulse 04/02","Stocks resumed their slide and Treasury yields held near one-month lows in the hours before President Donald Trump’s tariffs announcement, with speculation swirling over the details of the proposed trade action. Several proposals are said to be under consideration, including a tiered tariff system with a set of flat rates for countries, as well as a more customized reciprocal plan. The White House has said the tariffs would take immediate effect, but that Trump was open to subsequent negotiation. The European Union said it will use a broad range of options to retaliate against the US if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to impose so-called reciprocal tariffs on the bloc this week.

KIGKDjqF2Fs,Trump Tariffs: New US Import Tax Less Than 24 Hours Away | Bloomberg The Pulse 04/01,"US stock futures retreated and gold extended its winning streak as the arrival of US tariffs loomed over markets. Investors continued to snap up haven assets, sending gold to a new record high and knocking 10-year Treasury yields about three basis points lower. Traders got further details on when Trump will announce his reciprocal tariff plan — 3pm on Wednesday at an event in the White House Rose Garden — but the extent of his levies remain unclear. Trump has already placed levies on Canada, Mexico and China — the US’s three largest trading partners — as well as automobiles, steel and aluminum. Import taxes on copper could come within several weeks. Trump has also threatened duties on pharmaceutical, semiconductor and lumber imports. In Europe, Marine Le Pen’s election ban risks a surge in anti-establishment sentiment in France that could undermine efforts to stabilize the nation’s creaky public finances. The court decision to bar the far-right leader from the 2027 presidential race jeopardizes the delicate peace that has allowed President Emmanuel Macron’s government to pass a budget for 2025. It makes a no-confidence motion in parliament more likely and potentially hands control of Le Pen’s National Rally to a largely untested 29-year-old.

kpyV5Rl0KGc,Trump 'Very Angry' at Putin; France's Le Pen Guilty | Bloomberg The Pulse 03/31,"President Donald Trump said he was “very angry” at Vladimir Putin and threatened “secondary tariffs” on buyers of his country’s oil if the Russian leader refuses a ceasefire with Ukraine. In comments reported by NBC News, Trump said he was “pissed off” at Putin for casting doubt on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s legitimacy as a negotiating partner, and threatened curbs on “all oil coming out of Russia.” He later added that he didn’t think the Russian president would “go back on his word.” In France, far-right leader Marine Le Pen was convicted of embezzlement by a Paris court — but judges haven’t yet said if she will pick up a ban that stops her from running to be France’s next president.

b_C_fyU-gao,"Earthquake Rocks Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam; US Ukraine Investment Aims | Bloomberg The Pulse 03/28","Myanmar was struck by its biggest earthquake in a century, shaking buildings and triggering evacuations in neighboring Vietnam and Thailand, with at least one tower collapsing in Bangkok. The quake on Friday measured 7.7 in magnitude, according to the USGS, which said it was 16 kilometers northwest of Sagaing, Myanmar and at a depth of 10 kilometers. It struck at about 1:21 p.m. in Bangkok and was the strongest worldwide since 2023, according to the US Geological Survey data compiled by Bloomberg. There was a second temblor of 6.4 magnitude around the same area, the USGS said. In geopolitics, the US is pushing to control all major future infrastructure and mineral investments in Ukraine, potentially gaining a veto over any role for Kyiv’s other allies and undermining its bid for European Union membership. President Donald Trump’s administration is demanding the “right of first offer” on investments in all infrastructure and natural resources projects under a revised partnership deal with Ukraine, according to a draft of the document obtained by Bloomberg News.

9brzfAxIo54,"Trump's Europe, Canada Threats, Auto Tariffs; Macron's Ukraine Talks | Bloomberg The Pulse 03/27","President Donald Trump signed a proclamation to implement a 25% tariff on auto imports and pledged harsher punishment on the EU and Canada if they join forces against the US, expanding a trade war and triggering threats of retaliation. “What we’re going to be doing is a 25% tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said. Hours later, Trump suggested further tariffs would be imposed on the European Union and Canada if they worked together “to do economic harm” to the US. The reaction in currency markets including the euro and Canadian dollar was muted. Meanwhile, European leaders are trying to carve out a role for themselves in US-led ceasefire talks over Russia’s war in Ukraine as more than 30 of them gather Thursday for an impromptu defense summit in Paris. Ahead of the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a new package of €2 billion ($2.2 billion) in military aid to Kyiv and said leaders would address how to strengthen Ukraine’s army, which would still remain the main line of protection in any kind of peace settlement.

e17l9qF_MCU,Trump Says Putin Possibly Delaying Black Sea Ceasefire | Bloomberg The Pulse 03/26,"The US said Russia and Ukraine agreed to a ceasefire in the Black Sea, even as the Kremlin said its involvement would depend on a series of preconditions, including sanctions relief. In separate statements, the White House said Tuesday that three days of technical-level talks in Saudi Arabia with teams from Russia and Ukraine had yielded agreements “to ensure safe navigation” in the Black Sea. The sides had also agreed to prevent the use of commercial shipping for military purposes, it said.

tac1OBsNG40,"Trump Officials JD Vance, Hegseth, Waltz In Text Message Breach | Bloomberg The Pulse 03/25/2025","The Atlantic’s top editor said he was added to a text group in which top US officials discussed detailed plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen with other top US officials. Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg recounted in a 3,500-word story published Monday how he got a connection request on the Signal messaging app from someone identified as Michael Waltz. He initially believed the request was fake, but later realized the account belonging to the US national security adviser was genuine after the group discussed detailed plans for an attack on the Houthis, a militant group that has carried out numerous attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. Meanwhile, Trump appeared to invent a new weapon of economic statecraft on Monday by threatening what he dubbed “secondary tariffs” on countries that buy oil from Venezuela to choke off its oil trade with other nations. The threat, delivered via Truth Social post then confirmed in an executive order, said countries could face 25% tariffs on trade with the US if they purchase oil and gas from Venezuela, which is already under heavy US sanctions.

dLLAiPh7oyQ,"China's Xi Must Stop Fentanyl Flow to US, Says Daines | Bloomberg The Pulse","An American senator said China must halt the flow of fentanyl ingredients into the US before any trade negotiations, a demand that clouds the prospect of imminent leaders’ talks to ease tensions between the world’s two largest economies.
Steve Daines, a close ally of President Donald Trump, laid out the condition in meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing over the weekend. 
That contrasts with China’s claim that it has already forcefully cracked down on the fentanyl trade.

r60HG1-YsQU,"China Blasts Trump ‘Two-Faced Acts’; Some Canada, Mexico Tariffs Delayed | Bloomberg The Pulse","China’s top diplomat accused Donald Trump of taking a hypocritical approach to bilateral ties and denounced tariffs. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi defended his nation’s actions on stemming the flow of fentanyl to the US on Friday at a high-profile briefing, and accused the Republican leader of using the issue as a pretext to pressure his government. “The US shouldn’t return good with evil or even impose arbitrary tariffs on Chinese products,” he said on the sidelines of the NPC meeting in Beijing. “No country should fantasize that it can suppress China and maintain good relations with China at the same time,” Wang said. Meanwhile, Trump exempted Mexican and Canadian goods covered by the North American trade agreement known as USMCA from his 25% tariffs, offering major reprieves to the US’s two largest trading partners.

-o91z7nOpJU,Trump Trade War Erupts; China's Ambitious Growth; German Defense Rally | Bloomberg The Pulse,"US President Donald Trump defended his plan to remake the US through the biggest tariff increases in a century. “Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it’s happening, and it will happen rather quickly. There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that. It won’t be much.” Meanwhile, European stocks climbed and bonds in the region tumbled Wednesday morning on Germany’s plans to unleash hundreds of billions of euros for defense and infrastructure. Merz’s CDU/CSU and the rival SDU are speeding ahead with plans to boost investment rather than wait out a months-long process to form a governing coalition.

J1i6jGXV5Iw,"China, Mexico, Canada Tariffs Knock Europe Stocks; Ukraine Aid Latest | Bloomberg The Pulse","US President Donald Trump delivered on his threat to hit Canada and Mexico with sweeping import levies and doubled an existing charge on China, spurring swift reprisals that plunged the world economy into a deepening trade war. On Tuesday, for the second time in a month, China announced tariffs as high as 15% on US agricultural goods and banned trade with some defense companies. The Canadian government also announced a sweeping package of counter-tariffs against US-made products. Meanwhile the European Union will propose extending €150 billion in loans to boost defense spending as the bloc tries to adjust to President Trump’s abrupt pullback of American security on the continent. Trump has ordered a pause to all US military aid to Ukraine.

rRVpxGt70Qc,"German Election: What Conservative Merz Means for Eco, Trump, China, Ukraine | Bloomberg The Pulse","Germany’s conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz said he’ll move quickly to form a new government after he won Sunday’s federal election with a result that will require him to form a coalition. Merz’s CDU/CSU bloc won 28.6% of the votes, followed by 20.8% for the far-right Alternative for Germany, according to the provisional vote count by the Federal Returning Officer. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats finished third with 16.4%, the party’s worst result since World War II. “There’s no reasonable alternative to forming a government in Germany in a reasonable and timely manner,” Merz said in a debate Sunday night, adding that he wanted to form a coalition within the next two months. “The world isn’t waiting for us — Europe is waiting for Germany, that we take a stronger leadership role again.”

Zelenskiy comments come after meeting with US special envoy Keith Kellog, where the two discussed the battlefield situation, how to return Ukraine’s prisoners of war, and effective security guarantees. With Europe sidelined from US talks with Russia this week, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer will visit the White House next week. Support for Ukraine is also on the agenda for Germany as the country heads to the polls this weekend. Latest polls show that Friedrich Merz's CDU/ CSU alliance is maintaining leads among voters.

ceaHXq5ODQI,"Greece PM Mitsotakis on Trump Zelenskiy Comments, Ukraine, Defense Spending | Bloomberg The Pulse","European capitals reacted with shock to Donald Trump’s abrupt turn against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, seeking simultaneously to reassure Kyiv that it has the continent’s backing while trying to appease Washington. The US president on Wednesday embraced the Kremlin narrative, denouncing Zelenskiy as a “dictator.”  Speaking on the show, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis says the EU should “move from words to action” on defense spending and said joint financing is becoming part of the conversation for how to defend the bloc’s interests. Also on the show, Icelandic Prime Minister Kristrún Frostadóttir told Francine Lacqua she believes European members of the NATO defense alliance are showing willingness to contribute more to the region’s security.

Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said US taxpayers don’t need to worry about the security of their private data while Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team seeks to make the federal government more efficient. In geopolitics, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told European allies that the US will keep sanctions on Russia in place at least until a deal to end the Ukraine conflict is reached, even as his boss, President Donald Trump, said he’ll probably meet Vladimir Putin to discuss a settlement before the end of February. Bloomberg's Stephanie Baker says Trump's approach is a 'historic' shift in US foreign policy. Bloomberg's Stephanie Baker says Trump's approach is a 'historic' shift in US foreign policy.

M5Mxw_FPMxQ,"Trump, Putin Teams Meet on Ukraine as Europe Sidelined; Musk Debuts xAI Model | Bloomberg The Pulse","Top US and Russian officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, started meeting in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss how to end the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned his country won’t recognize “any agreements about us without us.” The talks in Riyadh follow US President Donald Trump’s landmark phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin last week in which he reversed key US positions on the conflict. Overnight, fifteen people were injured, three critically, after a Delta regional jet flipped out of control after landing in windy, freezing conditions in Toronto, skidding along the runway and coming to rest upside down after losing its tail and one of its wings.

Top US and Russian officials are due to hold talks on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, following last week’s phone call between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on finding ways to resolve the war. Meanwhile several European Union leaders said the decision to omit a majority of member states from a hastily arranged summit in Paris risks sending the wrong signal about the bloc’s unity. President Emmanuel Macron invited seven nations, including the UK, to discuss defense spending Monday after the sharp US policy shift under Donald Trump.

GKL95iylDDM,"Putin, Trump Ukraine Talks No 'Betrayal' of Kyiv, says Hegseth | Bloomberg The Pulse","US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth denied President Donald Trump was betraying Ukraine by opening talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin. European leaders blindsided by Trump’s call with Vladimir Putin insisted they shouldn’t be sidelined after the US president said that he’d agreed to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine with his Russian counterpart, sweeping aside three years of US policy. Trump revealed the conversation on social media, saying the two had a “lengthy and highly productive phone call.” He said their teams would start negotiations immediately, and later told reporters in the Oval Office that he’ll probably meet Putin in Saudi Arabia in the “not-too-distant future.”

EUvoqqpzHTA,UK Recession Fears; Musk Defends Federal Job Cuts; China Mulls Vanke Debt Plan | Bloomberg The Pulse,"The UK economy may have shrunk in the fourth quarter, putting Britain back on the brink of recession and piling more pressure on Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves and her promise to turbo-charge growth. In the US, President Donald Trump directed agencies to work with Elon Musk’s government cost-cutting effort to slash their workforces, according to a White House official. Meanwhile in China, authorities are working on a proposal to help China Vanke Co. plug a funding gap of about 50 billion yuan ($6.8 billion) this year, according to people familiar with the matter, highlighting the government’s support for the distressed property developer.

q2L5Qfzlg-I,"Elon Musk has 'Insecurity', says OpenAI's Sam Altman, 'I feel for the guy' | Bloomberg The Pulse","OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman said the company is “not for sale” and Elon Musk is probably trying to delay its progress with an unsolicited bid for the artificial intelligence pioneer. “I think he is probably just trying to slow us down. He obviously is a competitor,” Altman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Tuesday on the sidelines of an AI summit in Paris.

Meanwhile, the European Union said it will respond to any tariffs the US might impose on it, escalating a potential transatlantic trade dispute. “Unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered — they will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures,” EU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said in a statement. On Monday, US President Donald Trump ordered a 25% tariff steel and aluminum imports.

He was speaking alongside James Manyika, Google's Senior Vice President of Technology & Society at the AI Action Summit in Paris, which has attracted world leaders and tech executives. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum into the US. Trump said the tariffs would apply to imports of both metals from all countries, including major suppliers Mexico and Canada. He didn’t specify when the duties would take effect. The president also said he would announce reciprocal tariffs this week on countries that tax US imports. Those would be enacted “almost immediately” after an announcement, Trump said, without providing further detail.

In geopolitical news, President Donald Trump reasserted his vision for a “spectacular” development in the Gaza Strip, led by the US and without Palestinians, in a social media post early Thursday.
Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Israel would hand over control of Gaza to the US “at the conclusion of fighting,” and that no US soldiers would be needed to execute his plan.

gZmQGbQ-CUE,"Musk ‘Buyout’ Plan Taken by 40,000 US Federal Workers | Bloomberg The Pulse","The Trump administration’s offer to pay federal employees through the end of September if they agree to leave by the end of February has attracted more than 40,000 sign-ups as of Wednesday — about 2% of the federal civilian workforce. An Office of Personnel Management official familiar with the deferred retirement data said that number was growing, and the administration expected a rush of applications in the final 24 hours. The deadline to apply — which can be done simply by sending the word “resign” from a government e-mail account — is the end of the day Thursday Washington time. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin told defense officials that their ""main objective"" was to repel the Ukrainian invasion of Russia's Kursk region, but six months later, they're still trying.

RpzJwL4voGM,Apple Faces Possible China Probe; Trump Says US Should Take Over Gaza | Bloomberg The Pulse,"Donald Trump said the US should take control of the devastated Gaza Strip. “The US will take over the Gaza Strip,” Trump said Tuesday during a White House news conference alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site.” In Israel, most politicians welcomed Trump’s remarks, saying they were an original way of trying to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the rest of the Middle East, the reaction was negative. The Palestine Liberation Organization, which represents political groups in Gaza and the West Bank, said it was “steadfast” in opposing any displacement of Gazans from their “homeland.” In other news, China's antitrust watchdog is examining Apple's policies, including taking a cut of up to 30% on in-app spending and barring external payment services and stores.

9WAOu5TzRbo,"China's Xi Hits Back at Trump Tariffs, Investigates Google | Bloomberg The Pulse","China retaliated to Donald Trump’s opening trade war tariffs by targeting a handful of American companies and slapping levies on some US goods. Beijing imposed a 15% levy on less than $5 billion of US energy imports and a moderate 10% fee on American oil and agricultural equipment on Tuesday, moments after new US tariffs entered effect. In more targeted measures, authorities put Calvin Klein owner PVH and US gene sequencing company Illumina on a so-called blacklist of entities that could affect their sizable operations in China, and imposed new export control on tungsten and other critical metals used in electronic, aviation and defense industries. President Xi Jinping’s response appeared carefully calibrated to avoid major blowback on China’s economy while showing Trump an ability to inflict damage on a range of fronts, including by disrupting the key minerals supply chain and hurting US companies with major operations on the mainland.

He warns the EU is next, calling the bloc an “atrocity” on trade. Trump’s move is the most extensive act of protectionism taken by a US president in almost a century, with knock-on effect on everything from inflation to geopolitics and economic growth. EU leaders are meeting for a retreat to discuss defense spending in the context of Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine and Trump’s demands that the bloc spend more. On Monday, EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said, “If the US and Europe start a trade war, the one laughing on the side is China.

Meanwhile President Donald Trump is poised to unleash his first wave of tariffs Saturday, sending foreign governments and businesses rushing to skirt potential duties and prepare for retaliation. The targets are unlikely ones: Canada and Mexico, the two biggest buyers of US goods. Trump has pledged 25% tariffs on about $900 billion in goods from both nations, whose trade surpluses with the US have long chafed the president.

The CRJ700 regional jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew had come in from Wichita, Kansas, when it hit the Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk helicopter with three military personnel on board while approaching the runway just before 9 p.m. local time. Search and rescue operations for survivors in the Potomac River is ongoing. US President Donald Trump said the plane crash is a “bad situation” that looks like “it should have been prevented,” according his post on Truth Social. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said in a video statement that the carrier was actively working with state and federal authorities. On corporate news, it was a mixed bag of earnings for US tech. Bloomberg Intelligence's Matt Bloxham breaks down the report cards for Microsoft, Tesla and Meta.

jDax-3B5Xuo,What Is China's DeepSeek; Why AI Tech Stocks Falling? | Bloomberg The Pulse,"Global equities retreated as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek threatened to disrupt US firms’ artificial intelligence dominance.  DeepSeek’s latest AI model comes as four of the Mag-7 tech stockS post results later this week, with traders watching how the companies will defend their generous AI spending. DeepSeek is seen by some as cost-effective while running on less-advanced chips, posing a challenge to US industry leaders like Nvidia Corp. and their sky-high valuations. Meanwhile, Colombian traders are bracing for a volatile session on Monday as the South American nation reversed its decision to reject the return of the migrants after Trump announced an emergency 25% tariff on all Colombian goods coming into the US.

-jJZm2RwstU,"Trump's China Tariff Talk Lifts Stocks; EU's Dombrovskis on Europe, US Ties | Bloomberg The Pulse","US President Donald Trump says he’d prefer not to have to impose tariffs on China. “We have one very big power over China, and that’s tariffs, and they don’t want them,” the US leader told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview that aired Thursday in the US. “And I’d rather not have to use it. But it’s a tremendous power over China.” Markets have taken it as a positive sign that Trump stopped short of imposing tariffs on China in his first days in office. In European corporate news, Banca Monte dei Paschi made a surprise offer to acquire larger rival Mediobanca in a deal valued at €13.3 billion ($13.9 billion), adding a new twist in a series of takeover attempts that are shaking up Italy’s banking industry. Also on the show live from Davos today, EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis tells Bloomberg's Francine Lacqua the bloc needs to do more to keep up with the US and China.

CLL7sLkGbs8,"US Sanctions Russia Oil to China, India; Fmr UK Minister: 'Do Not Have a Weak Pound' | The Pulse","Oil rallied to the highest level in five months as a fresh wave of US sanctions against Russia’s energy industry threatened to crimp supplies from one of the world’s top producers. The US imposed its most aggressive and ambitious sanctions yet on Russia’s oil industry on Friday, targeting large exporters, insurance companies and more than 150 tankers. In the UK, the pound extended losses against the dollar, pressured by UK fiscal and economic concerns. But member of the UK House of Lords and former chairman at Goldman Sachs Asset Management Jim O'Neill tells Bloomberg's Francine Lacqua that sterling's moves are because of a strong dollar, not a weak pound. ""We have a very strong dollar and the dollar is rising against many, many currencies,"" O'Neill says. 

Today's guests: Janet Henry, HSBC Global Chief Economist; Jim O'Neill, member of the House of Lords and former Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

Speaking on Tuesday, Trump threatened to levy tariffs on Denmark “at a very high level” and when goaded with a question.

wLrx-MT43FA,China Tech Giant Tencent Blacklisted by US; Canada PM Trudeau Exit | The Pulse 01/07/2025,"The US has blacklisted Tencent Holdings and Contemporary Amperex Technology. for alleged links to the Chinese military. CATL, a major supplier to Tesla, joined Tencent on a Federal Register of entities deemed to have ties with the People’s Liberation Army. Both companies protested their inclusion as a mistake, saying they have no ties with the military. Tencent’s stock slid more than 7% in Hong Kong, notching its biggest drop since October. CATL’s shares fell about 3%. The blacklisting threatens to escalate tensions between the world’s two largest economies. In politics, the search is on for Justin Trudeau as the Canadian Prime Minister is resigning after more than nine years in power, bowing to dreadful polls and a rebellion within his governing Liberal party.

Meanwhile in Canada, the Globe and Mail reported that PM Justin Trudeau is expected to announce his resignation as leader of Canada’s Liberal Party this week. Trudeau has been under pressure from elected lawmakers in his party to quit for months. That has only intensified since Chrystia Freeland, his finance minister, stepped down on Dec. 16, saying she and the prime minister were at odds on policy.

GrIM0HfkS10,Tesla EV Car Sales Drop; Biden To Block US Steel Deal | Bloomberg The Pulse 01/03/25,"Tesla's annual vehicle sales dropped for the first time in more than a decade despite a year-end push that sent deliveries to a record in the fourth quarter. The Elon Musk-led company sold 1.79 million vehicles last year, it said Thursday, which was slightly less than what it delivered in 2023 and also below analysts’ consensus estimate. Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas writes that the miss reflects a “relatively aged product” and more competition. In the broader market, stocks were mixed at the end of a holiday-shortened and turbulent week. European stocks dropped, with miners sliding on concerns about Chinese demand. Stellantis fell as much as 3.8% as some EV models that had previously received US tax credits for electric vehicles were excluded under tougher rules.

_GMbhA7kkn0,"New Orleans Attack, Tesla Cybertruck Explosion Outside Trump Las Vegas Hotel | The Pulse 01/02/2025","A deadly attack in New Orleans' French Quarter on New Year's Eve killed at least 15 people and injured dozens, with the suspect, an American Army veteran, killed at the scene. Hours later, a deadly explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck outside of President-elect Trump’s hotel in Las Vegas further rattled Americans ringing in 2025. The incidents, which are both being probed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, prompted statements from Trump, President Joe Biden and other senior US officials. Meanwhile in commodities news, European gas prices advanced on the first trading day of the year as the region braced for freezing winter temperatures without a key source of supply. The halt coincides with forecasts for sub-zero temperatures in some countries, which will drive up heating demand.

T9USs3ThBKQ,Jimmy Carter Dies at 100; Jeju Air Crash in South Korea Kills 179 | Bloomberg The Pulse 12/30/24,"Jimmy Carter, the former Georgia peanut farmer who as US president brokered a historic and lasting peace accord between Israel and Egypt in a single term marred by soaring inflation, an oil shortage and Iran’s holding of American hostages, has died. He was 100. Carter died Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia, surrounded by his family, the Carter Center said Sunday in a statement. Public observances are planned in Atlanta and Washington, followed by a private interment in Plains. Tributes poured in from across the world, including from President Joe Biden, who said he’ll order a state funeral in Washington for  Carter. In South Korea, investigators are probing the cause of the worst civil aviation accident ever in the country, focusing on a bird strike and the unusual landing-gear failure in the final moments of the fateful flight that left all but two of the 181 occupants of the Boeing Co. 737 jet dead.

The White House announced Monday it would initiate the inquiry into so-called foundational chips — also known as legacy or mature-node semiconductors — made in China. While not as advanced as the chips driving artificial intelligence, the older technology is ubiquitous across a wide range of applications including autos, airplanes, medical devices and the telecommunications industry.

1PFpDKBMH84,"Trump Threatens Panama; Honda, Nissan Formalized Merger Talks | Bloomberg The Pulse 12/23/24","Panama’s president rebuffed Donald Trump’s threat to reimpose US control over the Panama Canal, saying its shipping tolls aren’t inflated and that sovereignty over the waterway isn’t negotiable. “Every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent zones is part of Panama, and it will continue to be,” President José Raúl Mulino said Sunday in a video statement on X, the social platform. In corporate news, Nissan Motor and Honda Motor agreed to start talks to merge under a holding company, which they plan to list in Aug. 2026. The two Japanese auto manufacturers signed a basic agreement for merger talks on Monday and held a joint media briefing in Tokyo. Honda also said it will buy back as much as ¥1.1 trillion yen ($7 billion) of its own shares.

Renault is eager for the Japanese company to find ways to become stronger given it isn’t itself willing to inject cash into Nissan, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. In geopolitics, Russian authorities have detained an Uzbekistan national on suspicion of killing a top general in a Moscow bomb attack. Moscow says he'd been recruited by Ukrainian security services to carry out the assassination.

q6Uo4xzFeaM,Ukraine Said to Kill Russian General Igor Kirillov | Bloomberg The Pulse 12/17/24,"Ukraine claimed responsibility for the assassination of the head of Russia’s radiological, chemical and biological defense troops in a bomb explosion in Moscow early Tuesday. Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, carried out the killing of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and his assistant, according to a person familiar with the operation. The SBU’s press office declined to comment. The two servicemen died when an explosive device planted on a scooter detonated near the entrance to an apartment building, Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement. The committee said investigators had opened a criminal case for murder. In economic news, Chinese leaders plan to set an annual growth goal of about 5% for next year and raise the budget deficit to 4% of gross domestic product, Reuters reported, citing two people it didn’t identify.

flzT7JmLihM,China Surprise Retail Consumption Slowdown; France Government Talks | Bloomberg The Pulse 12/16/24,"China’s retail sales growth unexpectedly weakened in November despite signs of improvement in the housing market. Retail sales rose 3% from a year ago, the slowest pace in three months and undershooting even the most bearish of forecasts. Industrial output increased 5.4%, keeping momentum as the manufacturing side of the economy continues to outperform consumer spending. In Europe, France’s new Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is meeting with far-right leader Marine Le Pen on Monday, kicking off an effort to form a government that can push a budget through a divided Parliament. The effort to form a government and craft a budget took on added urgency, after Moody’s Ratings over the weekend cut France’s credit rating, citing its weak finances and political gridlock.

aemmo8A9Lwo,"China Traders Want More Fiscal Easing, South Korea Politics | Bloomberg The Pulse 12/13/24","China’s bond rally got a shot in the arm from a key economic meeting, where promises of interest rate cuts helped send the benchmark yield to a fresh record low. Earlier this week, the Politburo, China’s top decision-making body, pledged “moderately loose” monetary policy in its first policy pivot in nearly 14 years. On top of easing bets, bonds are also supported by concerns over a potential trade war with the US and a lack of other investment options amid fragile sentiment on stocks and the property market. In politcs, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s approval rating slumped to its lowest level since he took office as he tried to defend his declaration of martial law and push back against efforts to oust him via impeachment.

Z3B8HMM3dCc,China's Xi Jinping Invited to Trump's Inauguration: CBS | Bloomberg The Pulse 12/12/24,"US President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration next month, according to CBS News. After a presidential campaign in which Trump vowed to impose a range of steep tariffs on Chinese imports, an invitation to the Jan. 20 inaugural would signal that the world’s two biggest economies can still maintain communication and perhaps even cooperate. However, no foreign head of state has attended an inaugural in at least a century, according to State Department records going back to 1874. In sports, Saudi Arabia was confirmed as host of the 2034 World Cup, marking the return of the world’s biggest sporting spectacle to the Gulf region for the second time in barely a decade and in a choice that’s already dogged by controversy.

5frliqZOfO8,US Mulls New Russia Oil Sanctions to Hit Putin; Israel Steps Up Syria Attacks | The Pulse 12/11/24,"The Biden administration is weighing new, harsher sanctions against Russia’s lucrative oil trade. Details of the possible new measures were still being worked out, but President Joe Biden’s team was considering restrictions that might target some Russian oil exports, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. In the Middle East, Israel stepped up its attacks on military sites in Syria, hitting hundreds of targets, from airfields to weapons production sites, and sending troops deeper into the country. The offensive targeted warehouses and weapons depots in several parts of Syria including the capital Damascus, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

NvFjoTTbXqg,China Stimulus Signal; CEO Shooting Suspect Luigi Mangione Arrested | Bloomberg The Pulse 12/10/24,"Global stocks slipped Tuesday as the impetus from China’s latest stimulus pledge faded and traders await key US inflation data later this week. Europe's STOXX 600 index snapped an eight-day streak of gains, with miners, luxury goods makers and energy stocks retreating, a day after they were boosted by Beijing’s pledge for looser monetary policy. In the US, police arrested 26-year-old Luigi Mangione in Pennsylvania on Monday for the fatal shooting of UnitedHealth Group Inc. executive Brian Thompson. Mangione was found with a manifesto, multiple fake identifications and a so-called ghost gun with a suppressor, similar to the one used in the shooting, according to police. Today's show was presented from Bloomberg's inaugural ""Women, Money & Power"" event in London, featuring some of the most influential voices in finance from around the world.

gQFHCgL1dow,"Assad's Fall Creates Power Vacuum, Israeli Troops Enter Syria | Bloomberg The Pulse 12/09/24","Bashar al-Assad is in Moscow after Islamist-led forces led a lightening advance through Syria, entering the capital on Saturday evening, and ending more than half a century of his family's rule. The world is still grasping the speed of events in recent days, and the collapse of a dynasty that laid waste to the country during a catastrophic civil war. But the implications are also quickly sinking in — and not least the prospect of more upheaval and violence as groups tussle for control. Meanwhile Israel said it carried out strikes against chemical weapons and missile-storage sites in Syria, describing the move as a preventive measure to ensure the safety of citizens after the fall of Assad.

s_2e-gEtJ7g,US Lets Ukraine Hit Some Russia Targets; Trump Cabinet Latest | Bloomberg The Pulse,"The US has lifted some restrictions on Ukraine’s use of Western-made weapons to strike limited military targets in Russia, according to people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile North Korea may deploy as many as 100,000 troops to aid Russia’s war on Ukraine if the alliance between Pyongyang and Moscow continues to deepen, according to people familiar with assessments made by some Group of 20 nations. In US politics, the search for Donald Trump’s chief economic policymaker devolved into disarray over the weekend, with contenders tussling for support, aides scrambling to find alternative candidates and the president-elect fuming over the behind-the-scenes jockeying that has spilled into public view.

nOJtMU3q2-Q,Trump's Pick of Matt Gaetz as Attorney General Shocks Washington | Bloomberg The Pulse 11/14/24,"Donald Trump is nominating Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general. Gaetz has been a steady ally of Trump since he left the White House. Gaetz has been plagued by scandals, including an investigation by the Justice Department that he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl in exchange for money. He denied the allegations and was notified last year that he wouldn’t face charges. Gaetz was also targeted by the House ethics panel. The President-elect is also nominating former US Representative and one-time Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard to be his director of national intelligence, elevating a loyalist and sceptic of support for Ukraine to coordinate the nation’s spy agencies.

u9KvG4GXabY,Trump Taps Elon Musk & Vivek Ramaswamy for Govt Efficiency Effort | Bloomberg The Pulse 11/13/24,"Billionaire Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new Department of Government Efficiency tasked to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,” President-elect Donald Trump announced. The structure may allow Musk to avoid resigning from his companies including Tesla, the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer, and SpaceX, which dominates the worldwide rocket launch market. In Europe, Germany’s election campaign kicks into high gear today.

L8P8OsHwTvs,"Marco Rubio Poised to be Trump's Sec. of State; Bitcoin Nears $90,000 | Bloomberg The Pulse 11/12/24","President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Marco Rubio as secretary of state, a person familiar with the matter said, granting a top job in his second administration to a one-time rival who later became one of his most ardent supporters in the Senate. Rubio has taken an aggressive stance on China’s emergence as an economic power and has supported Israel’s war in Gaza and its attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon, while also being a strong supporter of NATO. He served on both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee. Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally took the digital asset past $89,000 and lifted the overall value of the crypto market above its pandemic-era peak as traders bet on a boom under President-elect Donald Trump.

SjnnBPszBpw,"Trump Victory Pushes Bitcoin Past $81,000 | Bloomberg The Pulse 11/11/24","Bitcoin rallied past $81,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers. His decisive victory in the presidential election has prompted celebratory chest-thumping from the digital-asset industry, which spent over $100 million backing a range of crypto-friendly candidates. Meanwhile in Europe, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said he’s open to moving up a parliamentary confidence vote by several weeks to before Christmas. Scholz, whose three-party government collapsed last week, said the shift in timing would depend on an agreement between parliamentary leaders of his Social Democratic Party and the two parties backing Friedrich Merz, the Christian Democrat who’s seeking the chancellorship in a bid to move Germany toward more conservative policies.

paoVmt3aj1Q,China's $1.4 Trillion Debt Crisis Plan As Trump Returns | Bloomberg The Pulse 11/08/24,"China announced a 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) program to refinance local government debt. Asia's largest economy is hoping to resolve its local government hidden debt crisis by raising the debt ceiling to 35.52 trillion yuan. The package has disappointed markets, which were expecting more stimulus measures to boost domestic demand and offset potential export losses due to Trump's tariff threats. Also on the show today, we spoke exclusively to the Czech central bank Governor Ales Michl on the country's rates outlook and how the auto sector will operate under a Trump presidency across the Atlantic.

6qaixpRIs_c,"What Trump Win Means for Russia-Ukraine War, Tensions in Mideast | Bloomberg The Pulse 11/07/24","Donald Trump's relationships with world leaders is set to shape global events. The US President-elect might strain the unity of NATO allies and put the future of aid for Ukraine in doubt. China, a rare bipartisan target in Washington, is in the crosshairs of a new Trump administration, with his calls for tariffs of as much as 60% on Chinese goods. In the Middle East, Israel may feel further emboldened in responding to Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to hail “history’s greatest comeback!” in a post on X addressed to “Dear Donald and Melania Trump.”

f11bw1PdfNQ,US Election Results: Donald Trump Nears Victory Over Harris | Bloomberg The Pulse 11/06/24,"The so-called ""Trump trade"" is in full swing with the Bloomberg US Dollar Index and US stock futures hitting new highs. Donald Trump is on the cusp of recapturing the White House, projected as the winner across pivotal battleground states with his party set to control the Senate and markets swinging in expectation of his likely triumph. In an address to supporters at his election watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump called it “a political victory that our country’s never seen before.” Republicans also won control of the US Senate, flipping seats in at least Ohio and West Virginia while successfully fending off challenges in Texas and Nebraska.

5eRVNd6-i2w,"Harris, Trump Hit Battlegrounds as Polls Signal Tight Finish | Bloomberg The Pulse 11/04/24","A flurry of polls released Sunday show Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump remain poised for a photo finish in this week’s presidential election, with voters narrowly split both nationally and across the pivotal swing states that will decide the election. The dollar fell as investors walked back bets on Trump winning the election. Meanwhile, oil prices advanced after OPEC+ agreed to push back its December production increase by one month and tensions escalated again in the Middle East. Iran escalated its rhetoric against Israel with supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning of a “crushing response” in a speech on Saturday.

1BhiWsT5koI,Tesla's Blowout Quarter with Ambitious 2025 Targets | Bloomberg The Pulse 10/24/24,"Tesla's shares in premarket trade soared Thursday morning after the EV maker reported its biggest quarterly profit in more than a year and issued upbeat forecasts for 2025. CEO Elon Musk added $80 billion to the company's market value after strong quarterly earnings driven by Cybertruck sales. Also in the transportation sector, Boeing factory workers rejected a new labor contract that would have increased their wages by 35% over four years. In markets, New this Thursday morning, traders are favoring a half-point ECB rate cut in December. Money markets boosted the chance of that outcome to more than 50% for the first time on Thursday, after poor French manufacturing and services data added to the drumbeat for more aggressive easing to tackle Europe’s slowing economy.

TmY7VHqNIBE,"Coffee Giant Starbucks' Sales Fall in US, China | Bloomberg The Pulse 10/23/24","Starbucks pulled guidance for 2025 after sales plunged for a third consecutive quarter, calling attention to the scope of the problems facing new Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol. Meanwhile, a severe E. coli outbreak tied to McDonald’s’s Quarter Pounders sickened dozens of people in the US, mainly in Colorado and Nebraska, and killed one, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In central bank news, ECB President Christine Lagarde said disinflation is on the right track, describing recent numbers as “relatively reassuring.” The direction of European Central Bank borrowing costs is clear but the pace at which they’ll be lowered is still to be decided, according to President Christine Lagarde, who didn’t rule out bigger moves. Lagarde spoke to Francine Lacqua on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington DC.

Fyc8Pc-7CyU,ASML CEO on China Chip Tariffs; Tech CEOs in London | Bloomberg The Pulse 10/22/24,"ASML's CEO Christophe Fouquet expects pressure will grow from the US to further restrict sales of semiconductor technology to China, the biggest market for the Dutch producer of chipmaking machines. “If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the US will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Fouquet said in an interview during the Bloomberg Tech Summit in London. “The question is what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?”. Staying in Europe, car sales on the continent fell in September for the first consecutive monthly decline in more than two years as the region’s economy continued to stagnate and consumers trimmed spending.

R0tvmxyj-jU,"Donald Trump Talks Tariffs, Putin, Fed in Bloomberg Interview | Bloomberg The Pulse 10/16/24","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump defended his plans to overhaul the US economy through dramatic tariff increases and more direct consultation with the Federal Reserve, arguing that his policies would result in substantial growth despite projections that his agenda would fuel inflation and spike the national debt. In an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, Trump also declined to say if he had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin since leaving office in 2021. In corporate news, ASML extended losses following its profit warning on Tuesday, sending ripples across the chipmaking sector.

However, the self-driving taxi prototypes let down some Tesla investors, with many expecting more particulars on how the carmaker can possibly pull off his latest robocar predictions. Also on the show, Williams F1 Racing Principal James Vowles says the team is putting off plans that would benefit performance on the track in favor of investing money in the 2026 season, when new regulations are put into effect.

President Biden criticized Donald Trump and his Republican allies for what he said were “outright lies” about the federal response to back-to-back hurricanes, saying the administration was doing everything it could to help impacted communities. “It’s harmful to those who need help the most. There’s simply no place for this to happen,” Biden said. “Former President Trump has led the onslaught of lies.”

Now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is locked in a multi-front conflict with no clear end is sight.

Hill joined Nike in 1988 and served as president of consumer and marketplace before he retired in 2020. Shares of the athletic brand jumped in Friday's early session. Elsewhere, Mercedes-Benz Group shares fell the most in four years after a deepening slowdown in China prompted the world’s biggest luxury-car maker to cut its outlook.

j3JvcchhH7A,Big Fed Rate Cut; Israel Sees 'New Phase' in War After Lebanon Blasts | Bloomberg The Pulse 09/19/24,"Stocks rallied across the globe as the Federal Reserve’s half-percentage-point interest-rate cut reignited investor sentiment. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index advanced as much as 1.3% in early trade on Thursday. US equity futures soared, with a 1.5% gain in S&P 500 contracts putting the underlying benchmark on course to test a record high in the cash market. Nasdaq 100 contracts jumped 2%, fueled by bets of resilient American growth and lower borrowing costs. In geopolitics, more telecom devices, including walkie-talkies, have exploded across Lebanon. The country's health ministry says the explosions have killed 26 people over two days and wounded more than 3,000. Meanwhile, Israel's military has declared a new phase in the war and says troops are to be diverted to its northern border.

h0IwwUK3U9M,"Pager Explosions in Lebanon, Fed Day | Bloomberg The Pulse 09/18/24","A string of medical emergencies were reported Tuesday afternoon following the mysterious explosion of thousands of pagers used by Lebanese people, including members of the militant group.  Hezbollah has accused Israel of orchestrating coordinated attacks in Lebanon, which killed several and wounded almost three thousand people. Pagers, which Hezbollah members have been using to communicate, exploded across the country yesterday afternoon. Israel has yet to comment on the attacks. On the economic front, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower interest rates this week after holding borrowing costs at a two-decade high for more than a year.

x0gcrIf0o-Q,UniCredit CEO: Commerzbank Takeover is an Option | Bloomberg The Pulse 09/12/24,"In a Bloomberg exclusive, UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel said that a full takeover of Germany's Commerzbank is an option. “Conversations about an M&A or a further combination are on top” of current discussions around the stake, he said. On Wednesday, the Italian bank revealed that it now owned 9% of Commerzbank, adding all the shares the German government offered this week to a position it had quietly built in the market. The state is seeking to exit its stake in the bank it rescued after the 2008 financial crisis. Also on the program, IEA Head of Oil Markets Toril Bosoni joined us for an exclusive conversation as the agency says global oil demand growth is “slowing sharply” as China’s economy cools.

_MsjXmspF1U,Taylor Swift Endorses Kamala Harris After Trump Election Debate | Bloomberg The Pulse 09/11/24,"Taylor Swift announced her endorsement of Kamala Harris on Tuesday night, minutes after the Democratic presidential nominee wrapped up her first debate against Republican rival Donald Trump. The debate saw Harris draw from her past as a prosecutor, peppering in lines that appeared designed to needle Trump, including taunting him over the size of his rally crowds. Trump, meanwhile, moved to tie Harris to more liberal policy positions from her past, hammering her for saying she no longer backs a fracking ban and flatly calling her a Marxist.

cPWDwMhrDko,"Apple, Google Lose EU Top Court Battles | Bloomberg The Pulse 09/10/24","Apple lost its court fight over a €13 billion ($14.4 billion) Irish tax bill. The EU’s Court of Justice in Luxembourg backed a landmark 2016 decision that Ireland broke state-aid law by giving the iPhone maker an unfair advantage. The court ruled on Tuesday that a lower court win for Apple should be overturned, because judges incorrectly decided that the commission’s regulators had made mistakes in their assessment. The same court backed a once-record €2.4 billion ($2.6 billion) EU fine for Google abusing its monopoly power to crush rival shopping services. The landmark 2017 decision found the US tech giant illegally leveraged its search-engine dominance to give a higher ranking to its own product listings.

x5LUcWSlYiY,Trump Leads Harris By One Point: Latest Polls | Bloomberg The Pulse 09/09/24,"Global stocks staged a partial recovery on Monday after a sell-off triggered by cooling US jobs data. Europe STOXX 600 benchmark gained 0.5%, paring some of last week’s 3.5% loss. Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both advanced after the underlying indexes slumped Friday following the weaker-than-forecast US payrolls numbers. In politics, Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump leads Kamala Harris by a point in a new national poll by the NYT and Siena College.

9YNE39i7zUs,"Trump Vows 15% Corporate Tax, Taps Elon Musk For Federal Audit | Bloomberg The Pulse 09/06/24","Donald Trump has pledged to cut the corporate tax rate, slash regulations and audit the federal government as he unveils his economic plan running for the highest office in the White House. The centerpiece of his address was a push to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% for companies that make their products in the US. That move would be a large reduction from the current 21% rate — a key policy win from Trump’s own 2017 tax law. The former President also vowed to establish a task force to review federal expenditures, an idea recommended by Tesla and SpaceX CEO, Elon Musk. Trump said the commission would be “tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms.”

lvUkr1W0EhU,Harris Pushes For 28% Capital Gain Tax; Stock Recovery Loses Steam | Bloomberg The Pulse 09/05/24,"Vice President Kamala Harris has called for a 28% capital gains tax rate on people earning $1 million or more, touting it as a measure that would ensure the wealthy paid their fair share as she sought to detail her economic agenda and draw a contrast with Republican rival Donald Trump. Meanwhile, global equities steadied after days of declines. Europe’s STOXX 600 index was little changed, with tech heavyweight ASML Holding NV and luxury stocks among the biggest losers. Mining equities declined for a fourth session after iron ore fell to the lowest since 2022.

PDHJ3yaImOE,"Nvidia, Stocks Tumble; Netanyahu Won't Budge on War Despite Protests | Bloomberg The Pulse 09/04/24","A global flight from risk assets continued on Wednesday after fears about the US economy and a retreat from big tech triggered a sharp decline in US stocks.
Europe’s STOXX 600 index dropped 0.9% with technology stocks such as ASML Holding taking the biggest losses. S&P 500 futures pulled back 0.5% after the gauge suffered its worst day since the Aug. 5 market meltdown. Traders are now bracing for further volatility as they await Wednesday's US job openings report. In geopolitics, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is sticking to his hard-line approach on Hamas, in the face of mass protests at home over the killing of six hostages and the suspension of some British arms licenses.

They said the groundbreaking candidacy of the first woman of color to lead a major party presidential ticket had returned joy and hope to national politics. Meanwhile, Walmart Inc. raised about $3.6 billion by selling its stake in Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com Inc., winding down an eight-year partnership that appears to be paying diminishing returns amid a challenging landscape for Chinese tech giants.

The Zurich-based bank said net income was $1.1 billion, about double analyst estimates. Growth in deal-making revenue at the investment bank beat many Wall Street peers, while a lower than expected loss at the unit dedicated to winding down Credit Suisse legacy assets helped offset a miss in the wealth management division. CEO Sergio Ermotti said the bank has entered technical discussions with the government and regulators over plans to overhaul Switzerland’s rules around bank capital and liquidity. The revamp is one of the political consequences of the Credit Suisse collapse last year.

Meanwhile, UK unemployment fell unexpectedly, falling 0.2 percentage points to 4.2% in the three months to June, according to Office for National Statistics. Employment surged by 97,000, much stronger than the 3,000 increase that forecasters had expected.

gEH8ZbnweYc,Trump & Harris Agree to Debate | Bloomberg The Pulse 08/09/24,"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have agreed to hold their first presidential debate on the 10th of September. The two rival candidates will have their first face-to-face clash on ABC News, with Trump confident he'll hold the upper hand. Democrats have been invigorated by President Joe Biden’s decision to step aside, and polls show a surge of support for Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, her running mate unveiled earlier this week.

18QxGAAurks,Ukraine Pipeline Worries Push European Gas Prices to 2024 High | Bloomberg The Pulse 08/08/24,"European gas futures rose to the highest since December after a period of intense fighting in Russia’s Kursk region, which hosts a key gas intake point. The incursion is Ukraine’s largest assault on Russian territory since Vladimir Putin ordered the 2022 invasion of his neighboring country. Oil prices steadied as markets remain on edge over a possible retaliatory strike by Iran on Israel as payback for assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. In the UK, anti-racism protesters turned out in their thousands in towns and cities to counter far-right demonstrations that failed to materialize on Wednesday evening.

FjS3mUlDkAY,Harris VP Pick Tim Walz Targets Blue-Collar Pitch | The Pulse 08/07/2024,"Stocks rallied after the Bank of Japan moved to reassure markets in the wake of historic volatility sparked in part by its unexpected interest rate hike last week. US Vice President Kamala Harris bypassed the pick from a more politically valuable state — Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro — for Minnesota’s Tim Walz, opting for a folksy governor whose mocking of Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance as “weird” became a rallying cry for Democrats.

JnFBMyobgEQ,Google Loses US Antitrust Lawsuit | Bloomberg The Pulse 08/06/24,"Some calms have returned to markets as investors looked for bargains after Monday’s dramatic selloff. Europe’s STOXX 600 index rose 0.6% in early trade after Monday’s slump to a five-month low. Japan’s two key share gauges both jumped more than 9% at the close, after tumbling 12% the day before. S&P 500 futures climbed about 1%, signaling a rebound may be in store after the benchmark sank to the brink of a technical correction on Monday. Nasdaq 100 contracts gained 1.4%. Late Monday, a Washington judge has ruled that Google illegally monopolized the search market through exclusive deals. This is a win on the government's side in its first major antitrust case against a tech giant in more than two decades. The judge says Alphabet Inc. unit’s $26 billion in payments to make its search engine the default option on smartphones and web browsers effectively blocked any other competitor from succeeding in the market.

r5ZY2IB9UXo,"Nvidia, Apple Fall Amid Tech Selloff | Bloomberg The Pulse 08/05/24","The global stock rout accelerated on Monday, with losses cascading across tech shares. Europe’s Stoxx 600 benchmark slumped at the open and is set for its biggest three-day decline since June 2022. Traders are piling into bets that the US economy is on the verge of deteriorating so quickly that the Federal Reserve will need to start easing monetary policy aggressively — potentially before their next scheduled meeting — to head off a recession. Traders now see a roughly 60% chance of an emergency quarter-point cut within one week.

AFeSYV2EnBY,"Stocks Sink Lead by Tech, Amazon & Intel Plunge | Bloomberg The Pulse 08/02/24","The stocks selloff intensified on Friday as concerns deepened over the health of the US economy and the outlook for technology companies. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index dropped 1.5%. Nasdaq futures dropped 1.6% after disappointing results from Amazon and a weak sales report by Intel Corp. In Asia, Japan’s benchmark index sank by the most since 2016 as a stronger yen weighed on the outlook for the country’s export-orientated economy. Earnings from Amazon made investors question once again whether the returns from artificial intelligence are worth the cost, following similar underwhelming reports from Microsoft and Alphabet.

Z4zDR0b1LjI,Hamas Military No. 2 Mohammed Deif Killed | Bloomberg The Pulse 08/01/24,"Israel said it had confirmed that Mohammed Deif, Hamas’ second in command, was killed in a strike in Gaza on July 13. The military had previously said it was all but certain he had died in its attack in the city of Khan Younis. Hamas denied at the time that Deif was dead and said Israel’s operation against him had killed around 100 other people. In markets, US stocks surged after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled central bank officials are on course to cut interest rates in September. Comments highlighted a growing confidence at the Fed to dial back its restraints on the economy. Powell was careful, however, not to wed officials to a rate reduction should price data prove disappointing in the coming months.

LwDQ8Qt2gyw,German Economy Unexpectedly Shrinks | Bloomberg The Pulse 07/30/24,"German Bunds erased earlier gains after the German economy contracted in the second quarter on a quarterly basis, missing estimates, while most regional CPI readings picked up from the month prior.

KVnunlmcy5A,US Election: Democrats Fundraising Tops $50M as Biden Endorses Harris| Bloomberg The Pulse 07/22/24,"A Bloomberg review of ActBlue data shows that Democrats raised more than $50 million online Sunday after Joe Biden announced his exit from the 2024 presidential reelection race, and endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris. Biden couldn’t leverage the deep relationships and ties developed over five decades in Washington to stave off the calls for him to step aside in the race against Donald Trump. Kamala Harris’ first task in formally securing the Democratic presidential nomination will be to corral her former congressional colleagues, newly emboldened after a successful pressure campaign to force their party’s leader, Joe Biden, off the 2024 ballot.

The series of wagers — based on anticipation that the Republican’s return to the White House would usher in tax cuts, higher tariffs and looser regulations — had already been gaining ground since President Joe Biden’s poor performance in last month’s debate imperiled his re-election campaign.
