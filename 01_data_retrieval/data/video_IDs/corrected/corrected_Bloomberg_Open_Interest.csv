XYBlnWQ8k24,Apple Is Exempt From Trump's China Tariffs,"Apple gets some very good news from the White House and its stock jumps. Apple will be exempt from President Donald Trump's 125% tariffs on goods produced in China. This includes products such as iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirTags.
