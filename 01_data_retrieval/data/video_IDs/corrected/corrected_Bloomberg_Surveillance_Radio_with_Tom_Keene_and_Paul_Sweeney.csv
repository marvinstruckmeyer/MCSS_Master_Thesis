Mnvo4MnzApA,"Uncertainty and Tariffs | Bloomberg Surveillance | March 25, 2025","Bloomberg Surveillance hosted by Tom Keene & Paul Sweeney
March 25th, 2025

Featuring:

1) Sophia Drossos, Economist at Point72 Asset Management, discusses a cloudy market and compounding uncertainty and where the Fed goes from here. It comes as tariffs have been dominating the news flow this week, with US stocks soaring on Monday on signs that trade sanctions will be narrower than feared. However, signs of ""secondary tariffs"" could add another layer of uncertainty in markets.

2) Cam Dawson, CIO at NewEdge Wealth, on US equities and whether US exceptionalism is alive and well. It follows stocks having a strong session, with the Nasdaq 100 adding 2.2%, amid signs US trade sanctions will be narrower than feared.

3) Michael Darda, Chief Economist at Roth Capital Partners, joins for an extended discussion on US stagflation, productivity growth, and whether the Fed will have no choice but to cut rates. In a Bloomberg exclusive yesterday, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said he now sees just one interest-rate cut as likely this year, rather than two, with tariff hikes impeding progress on disinflation.

4) Phil Toews, CEO at Toews Asset Management, on his new book ""The Behavioral Portfolio"" and how portfolios have shifted as the US economy changes. Rising uncertainty on policy and geopolitics could lead traders to look for cheap assets and avoid expensive ones. It makes the future profits that contributed to the expensive stocks being expensive in the first place, look less certain.

5) Lisa Mateo joins with the latest headlines in newspapers across the US, including US retailers bulking up their inventories to get ahead of President Trump's new tariffs and British Airways launching a new first-class seat.
