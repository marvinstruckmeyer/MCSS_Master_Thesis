""It's hard to argue that you've got a good outcome,"" Raedler said on Bloomberg Television. ""Maybe you block a majority by the hard right. But in the best case scenario, you get a hung parliament. That effectively means very little decision making, no ability to deal with a very wide budget deficit, and also the European integration story effectively put on hold.""
